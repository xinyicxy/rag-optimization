PROJECT INFORMATION 1.1 ABOUT INCOURAGE Established in 1994, Incourage Community Foundation is a nationally recognized leader in place -based philanthropy and community change efforts. Incourage operates with a vision of a community that works well for all people. To achieve this vision, values of equity, inclusion and opportunity are applied to all work, and to the relationships Incourage fosters to accomplish its work. To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and subcontractors who: \uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius; \uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work; \uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work; \uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place; \uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to corporate social responsibility. Incourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement services under an AIA A133 contract structure with a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this RFP (the \u201cProject\u201d and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) . The selected Proposer will become the Construction Manager (CM). 1.2 DELIVERY METHOD The delivery method for the Project is \u201c Construction Manager at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133 based contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase. 1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND The Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the historic Tribune Building along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To date, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making process. As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new economy and co mmunity that works well for all. Page 2 To that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local economy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational rentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the functional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow human talent simultaneous to the local economy. The Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the value and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment that fosters and accepts failure; creativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship. 1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT In 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of Consolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more than a century. At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce. The dramatic economic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency would not serve their changed circumstances. The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in determining their own identity. By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the com munity\u2019s future. 1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE The Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets. Both the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are already meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area. The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local newspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design. The building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant. The revitalization will undoubtedly alter the deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper industry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an accessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers. The Tribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown and riverfront renaissance. The Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids. \uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A. \uf0b7 An Estimate of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \uf0b7 A Project Timeline is provided in Exhi bit C. All Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP. 1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American Institute of Architects) Construction Management at -risk is a process that allows the Owner of a Project to choose the Construction Manager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and then the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork together in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a Guaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately from the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained. 2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES The Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section 2.1. The Construction Manager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2. The Owner and Construction Manager may agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior",
