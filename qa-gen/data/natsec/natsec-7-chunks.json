Part B - Subcontractor/Teaming Partner Consent Letters executed by each teaming partner, joint venture partner and/or significant subcontractors authorizing the release of past performance information so the offeror can respond to such information. A sample consent letter is provided at HC1028 -16-R-0005, Section L, Attachment L-4. Part C - Client Authorization Letters for each identified effort for a commercial customer authorizing release to the Government of requested information on the offeror\u2019s performance. See HC1028 -16-R-0005, Section L Attachment L-5 for Client Authorization Letters . 5.3 Relevant Contract s a. Submit information using the format contained in Attachment L-1, Past an d Present Performance Information: Past Performance Information on no more than three recent (active within the past five years from the original issue date of this solicitation) contracts, this may include significant teaming partner\u2019s and/or significant subcontractor\u2019s past performance information submissions , that you consider most relevant in demonstrating you and your significant teaming partner\u2019s and/or significant subcontractor\u2019s ability to perform the proposed effort . The information submitted sh all reference only the offeror\u2019s, significant teaming partner\u2019s, or significant subcontractor\u2019s past performance on the submitted effort, rather than the past performance of other contractors on the submitted effort. b. In addition, the prime offeror s hall include information on a minimum of one recent contract performed by the prime offeror that you consider most relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort. Please see the maximum limitations set forth in subparagraph d below . c. Recent contracts are considered to be efforts that the prime offeror and its teaming partners, joint venture or significant subcontractors have performed within the past five years prior to original issuance of the solicitation, or for ongoing efforts the period of performance of which must have started at least nine months before the original proposal due date . d. The total of Past and Present Performance Information references will not exceed three pages per reference. Total page count for this Pa st Performance volume is annotated above in Table 2 -2. Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance. The Government uses degree s of relevanc y when assessin g recent , relevan t contracts in accordance wit h DoD Sourc e Selectio n HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 182 of 217 Procedures , paragraph 3.1.3.1, Table 4, exerted in Section M as Table 3, Past Performance Relevancy Ratings. The past performance evaluation team will consider the performance quality of relevant recent efforts for the second aspect of the past performance evaluatio n using Section M Table 4, Past Performance Quality Assessment. Finally, the past performance evaluation team will review this past performance information and determine the quality as it applies to performance confidence assessment. Performance Confiden ce Assessment ratings are identified in Section M, Table 5. 5.3.1 Specific Content Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the submitted past performance efforts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk. Merely having problems does not automatically equate to a limited or no confidence rating because the problems encountered may have been on a more complex program, or an offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the ability to overcome the problems encountered. The offeror is required to clearly demonstra te management actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified. Categorize the relevant information into the specific technical/management subfactors used to evaluate the prop osal. 5.3.2 Organizational Structure Change History Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection. As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this procurement. To f acilitate this relevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a \"roadmap\" describing all such changes in the organization of your company. A pamphlet or other commercial document describing such reorganizations may suffice. As part of this expl anation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/confidence assessment. Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provide d by the offerors, your \"roadmap\" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources . 5.4 Questionnaire s The offeror shall provide the Sample Questionnaire Cover Letter and Past Performance Questionnaire, found at HC1028 -16-R-0005, Section L, Attachments L-2 and L -3 respectively, to each of the customer POCs identified for each of the submitted past performa nce efforts. In order to expedite the assessment process, the offeror shall complete Sections I, II and III of the Past Performance Questionnaire for the convenience of the POC. The offeror shall not, however, complete any other section of the Past Perfo rmance Questionnaire. Once the questionnaires are completed by the POCs, the information contained therein shall be considered sensitive and shall not be released to the offeror. Early submission",

HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 183 of 217 6.0 Volum e IV - Cost/Price (Evaluation Factor 5) The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated, using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is reasonable and complete; a color rating is not assigned to the cost/price factor. Normally, price reasonableness is established through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. The Government will determine completeness of the offeror's proposal by verifying that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs are presented in a clear and useful format. The Government will evaluate offerors' proposed costs for reasonableness, completeness, affordability and realism. 6.1 General Instructions 6.1.1 Cost Reasonableness, Realism, and Completeness This section is to assist you in submitting cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the reasonableness, completeness, realism, balance, and/or affordability of your proposed cost. The Government will v erify that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly calculated, and prices are presented in a clear and useful format. Note that unrealistically low or high proposed costs, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for elimina ting a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has submitted an unrealistic proposal. Additionally, unbalanced costs pose an unacceptable risk to the Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror\u2019s proposal. Cost submissions should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness and be adequate enough to support and sustain a DCAA audit. 6.1.2 Cost/Price Information Information beyond that required by this instruction shall not be submitted, unless you consider it essential to document or support your cost/price position. All information relating to the proposed price, including all required supporting documentation must be included in the section of the proposal designated as the Cost/Price Volume. Under no circumstances shall this information and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal . Labor and overhead rates should include sufficient detail to sustain a DCAA audit (e.g., direct labor rates, overhead, fring e benefits, General and Administrative Expense (G&A), fee, etc.). The offeror must provide the basis of estimate for all rates with detailed rationale to support the rates. For indirect rates, the preferred method for providing support detail is throug h the submission of a Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) or Forward Pricing Rate Recommendation (FPRR). However, in the absence of a FPRA/FPRR, the Government will accept all rates and factors by year utilized in the development of the Forward Pricing R ate Proposal and the basis for these rates and factors (e.g., breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data). If the contractor is not required to maintain forward pricing rates then the Government will accept other methods of validation. These methods include approved provisional billing rates, other submitted/approved rates, or the submission of proposed rate calculations (including the pools & bases) and the basis of all calculations (e.g., breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data). The offeror shall state if rates have been provided to the cognizant Administrative Contracting HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 184 of 217 Officer /DCAA office for review or negotiation; if rates have not been submitted, explanation is required. If a subcontractor relationship exists, subcontract costs must also be deline ated in accordance with the requirements above. If needed, the subcontract may submit its unsanitized cost breakout directly to the Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer. The subcontractor shall also provide contact information for its cognizant DCAA o ffice. 6.1.3 Cost or Pricing Information Requirement s In accordance with FAR 15.403 -1(b) and 15.403 -3(a), data other than certified cost or pricing data may be required to support cos t reasonableness. Information shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403 -5. If, after r eceipt of proposals, the contracting officer determines the required conditions of adequate competition do not exist that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403 -1 apply, the offeror may be required to certify its submitted cost or pricing data . 6.2 Volume Organization The Cost/Price volume shall consist of the following sections : Part A -Introductio n Table of Contents; summary descriptions of estimating, purchasing, and accounting systems; changes to estimating, accounting practices, or Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) d isclosure statement . Part B -Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet s Cost or pricing information and supporting data, to include estimating methodology .

Provide complete rationale for any exceptions . 6.3 Part A -Introductio n 6.3.1 Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms. If necessary, provide a glossary of abbreviations and acronyms used with an explanation for each. Glossaries do not count against the page limitations for their respective volumes . 6.3.2 Estimating Syste m Provide a summary description of your standard estimating system or methods. The summary description shall cover separately each major cost element (e.g., direct mat erial, engineering labor, manufacturing labor, indirect costs, ODC, overhead, G&A, etc.). Also, identify any HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 185 of 217 deviations from your standard estimating procedures in preparing this proposal volume. Indicate whether you have Government approval of your syst em and if so, provide evidence of such approval . 6.3.3 Purchasing Syste m Provide a summary description of your purchasing system or methods (e.g., how material requirements are determined, how sources are selected, when firm quotes are obtained, what provi sion is made to ensure quantity and other discounts).
