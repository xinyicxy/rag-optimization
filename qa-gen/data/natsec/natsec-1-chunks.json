Task Orde r Title. Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) 7.0 Modernization 3. Backgroun d. The AFATDS is a multi -service, automated Command, Coordination, Communication, and Computing system that provides automated fire support and coordination to a ll echelons, from Firing Unit through Theater Level, at Army, Marine Corps, Naval Firing Platforms, Navy Command and Amphibious Assault Ships, Air Force Operations Centers and Joint Command and Control Centers. AFATDS enables the Force Commander\u2019s guidanc e to be automatically applied in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan, execute, and deliver effects at all levels of command within the current and future force. AFATDS can automatically tailor the selection of fire support assets (field artillery, morta rs, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters and offensive electronic warfare assets) based on Commander\u2019s Guidance, thereby enabling maximum effective use of all available fire support assets across the full spectrum of conflict. It is the G overnment\u2019s objective to modernize the underlying AFATDS architecture, redesign the AFATDS fron t-end to a fully web and role based interface, integrate available common services made available through the Army\u2019s Common Operating Environment (COE) and incorporate advanced embedded training technologies to aid in operator initiated system instruction and refresher training. This next generation version of AFATDS is referred to as AFATDS 7.0. 4. Objectives : This SOO defines the to p-level objectives for AFAT DS 7.0. A supplemental AFATDS 7.0 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) (RFP attachment J -1) provides amplified details for the technical requirements discussed in this SOO. See section 14 of this document for instructions to obtaining the SRS . 5. Scop e. The scope of the AFATDS 7.0 effort includes system architecture design and analysis, system software interface support, design/system engineering and system integration. This effort includes software design and development, programmatic, engineering, t esting, training, and integration for the implementation of the AFATDS capability in support of fires operational requirements within the Army and Marine Corps operational architecture from fires platoon to echelon above Corps, Joint and",

Program Objectives 6.1 Task 1- AFATDS 7.0 Overarching Program Objective s 6.1.1 Subtask 1 Acquire an AFATDS 7.0 software baseline that is Smart Client and Web Client based, no longer dependent upon a traditional thick client for accessing fires HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 16 of 217 functionality. The AFATDS 7.0 will allow a user to access fires capabilities from a commodity end us er device. In environments with reliable network connectivity and server infrastructure, the user will interact with AFATDS 7.0 via a browser that reaches back to a server hosting the AFATDS 7.0 application(s) and COE common services. In environments wi th less reliable network connections or those where server infrastructure is not available, the AFATDS 7.0 application(s) will be locally hosted on the end user device . 6.1.2 Subtask 2 Acquire an AFATDS 7.0 software baseline that has application(s) implemented in HTML5 when used as a Web Client. Smart Client instances will be implemented using HTML5 or as a native Android application(s) . 6.1.3 Subtask 3 Acquire an AFATDS 7.0 software baseline that maximizes the use of common services made available from the COE en vironment; thus, allowing the AFATDS 7.0 developer to focus their primary efforts on the development of fires capabilities and integration tasks associated with accessing external services. 6.1.4 Subtask 4 Acquire an AFATDS 7.0 software baseline that utilize s Industry Best Practices for the development of the fron t-end interface to ensure a modern rol e-based user interface. The interface will be designed in a manner to be innately usable to intended Army and Joint users. The interface will dynamically tailo r itself to the needs of different user roles accessing the system so that irrelevant information and capability is hidden while relevant capabilities are exposed . 6.1.5 Subtask 5 Acquire an AFATDS 7.0 software baseline that utilizes the most modern training te chnologies available. These training technologies will offer on -screen (embedded) guided support to users who need refresher training or a d-hoc guidance on a specific capability; and training will be animated and interactive as opposed to text based and m ust be accessible directly from the AFATDS 7.0 system without additional modules or software being installed. 6.1.6 Subtask 6 Acquire an AFATDS 7.0 software baseline that implements a service based architecture. These services will be connected to a common Enterprise Service Bus defined by the COE. Utilization of existing enterprise service technology within AFATDS will be discontinued in favor of the common service bus in the COE. 6.1.7 Subtask 7 Acquire an AFATDS 7.0 software baseline that supports existing and new munitions variants, to include smart munitions that will encompass but not be restricted to the following types: a) New and/or improved artillery, shell, fuze, propellants; b) New a nd/or improved mortar munitions for Army and the Marine Corps Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS); c) New and/or improved Rocket Missile Munitions. These munitions will have new ranges, lethality, accuracy, and/or shell/fuze/charge combinations. The se updated characteristics will be reflected in the appropriate AFATDS 7.0 components as determined by munition type . HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 17 of 217 6.1.8 Subtask 8 Acquire an AFATDS 7.0 software baseline that supports upgrades to existing weapon platforms, new weapon platforms or platform v ariants, to include hosted fire control systems (e.g. Paladin, M777, Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), EFSS, Mortar Systems, M119A3). AFATDS 7.0 will accommodate changes in message data to/from platform s to support new ballistic and non -ballistic trajectory, range and rate requirements. AFATDS 7.0 will also support the elimination of outdated munitions and weapon systems . 6.1.9 Subtask 9 Acquire an AFATDS 7.0 software baseline that supports enhancement of current behavior that supports current platforms and munitions. This will include but not be limited to multiple precision targets, mixed munitions loads, mixed weapon types within unit, increased message automation (fewer manual class 3 messages) and longer range communications with platforms . 6.1.10 Subtask 1 0 Acquire an AFATDS 7.0 software baseline that will in no way result in a loss of current capability or interoperability. The same capabilities that can be performed by AFATDS 6.8.1.1 today must still be available from the AFATDS 7.0 system, unless otherwise noted in the AFATDS 7.0 SR S 6.1.11 Subtask 1 1 Acquire an AFATDS 7.0 software baseline that retires and consolidates: AFATDS Tactical and Logistics Access Screens (ATLAS) and Effects Management Tool (EMT). ATLAS will no longer be supported as an individual end item within the AFATDS product line.

HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 20 of 217 6.2.3 Subtask 3 Operate in CPCE and Mounted Computing Environment (MCE ) The AFATDS 7.0 architecture will be designed to work both within CPCE and MCE. Meeting the needs of both environments will require AFATDS 7.0 to be accessible from both web and smart client devices. When operating via a Web Client, AFATDS 7.0 will support all versions of ozone and the joint comm and and control common user interface that are targeted for COE v3 along with associated browsers. AFATDS 7.0 will run on supported server infrastructure planned for hosting COE web applications. When operating via a Smart Client, AFATDS 7.0 will run on C OE v3 end user device hardware and run within the resource constraints dictated by COE Technical Guidance . 6.2.4 Subtask 4- Maximize Use of CPCE Services AFATDS 7.0 will maximize the use of common services and architecture frameworks made available from within the COE environment. These services include : a. Mission Command Data Bus b. Semantic Extensible Attribute Model data mode l c. Unified Dat a d. Common CPCE/MCE Client Instantiation s \u2212 Smart Clien t \u2212 Web Clien t e.

To minimize the software maintenance burden associated with man aging two separate AFATDS 7.0 variants, the Government intends to implement AFATDS 7.0 as a web application(s) for use both on the Web and Smart Clients. Should the Contractor find that there is a significant challenge in supporting AFATDS 7.0 as a web ap plication(s) when running on a Smart Client, these concerns will be presented to the Government so alternatives can be discussed and selected . b. In addition to HTML5 web applications, MCE also allows for application developers to implement applications as native Android based applications. Development of AFATDS 7.0 as a native Android application(s) is not a preferred implementation method given portability challenges that may exist with this approach. c. If the Contractor finds that circumstances favor impl ementation of all or portions of AFATDS 7.0 as a native Android application(s), these factors will be brought to the attention of the Government for discussion and final decision. 6.2.6 Subtask 6 Legacy Code Review and Removal With utilization of common services available from COE being a major emphasis area for AFATDS 7.0, it is expected that certain capabilities within AFATDS may become duplicative with COE derived functionality. Organic functionality that is redundant with capability provided via COE will be removed from AFATDS 7.0. 6.2.7 Subtask 7 Data Distribution Service (DDS) Suppor t AFATDS 7.0 will interface with DDS via the publication and subscription services made available to Web and Smart Clients. Deltas between DDS capability found in previous AFATDS versions and AFATDS 7.0 when using the COE provided publication/subscription services will be brought to the attention of the Government for resolution. 6.2.8 Subtask 8 Messagin g All messaging formats and communication methods supported in AFATDS 6.8.1.1 will be retained in AFATDS 7.0. COE common services will be utilized as the primary means for meeting all messaging requirements for AFATDS. Deltas will be identified to the Government so that appropriate action can be taken. It remains possible tha t capability deltas may need to be filled via HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 22 of 217 development actions performed by the AFATDS 7.0 developer working in coordination with the primary service developer. 6.2.9 Subtask 9 External Interface Requirement s AFATDS 7.0 will support all external interfac es and devices as described in the AFATDS 7.0 SRS. 6.2.10 Subtask10 AFATDS Graphical User Interface Front En d The existing Fires Command Web (FCW) code base will be used as an initialization point for developing the AFATDS 7.0 Web Client front end. The following factors will be taken into account : a. All existing FCW code must be r e-written in HTML5. The origin of this requirement is that HTML5 is the agreed upon common standard for web based applications running within MCE and will likewise support runni ng in the CPCE framework . b. FCW today only represents a fraction of the total AFATDS fires capability. Those capabilities that exist today in AFATDS but not in FCW must be developed so they can be accessible via the HTML5 based AFATDS 7.0 web application( s). c. Support for the widest range of browsers is desired but at a minimum support for Firefox and Internet Explorer is required. Versions supported will at least be in compliance with versions of these browsers found on Army Golden Master (AGM) for the CO E v3 timeframe. 6.2.11 Subtask 11 Embedded Interactive Training AFATDS 7.0 will make use of embedded training technologies which enable the operator to initiate on demand training for all major portions of the system. The embedded training capability will, at a minimum, support the following : a. In Application Guidance: ability for the operator to receive instruction on a given AFATDS 7.0 capability from the screen without having to log into other applications or refer to non -digital (e.g. paper manuals) . b. Interactive: guidance provided to the user will be interactive so that the training system adapts to the user\u2019s clicks and inputs. For example, if the user has requested assistance on how to create a new target, the system will be expected to direct the user on how to fill out the target type then instruct the operator to make a selection. HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 23 of 217 c. On Screen Animation and Sound: visual and verbal guidance will be available on screen and via the local system\u2019s speakers when issuing instructions to the user. d. AFATDS 7.0 will be designed to decrease the amount of initial and sustainment training required to acquire and maintain proficiency in the use of AFATDS . e. Perform individual training programs and collective training vignettes . f. Operate the DFSTS on the plat form or from common core application server . g. Training Management System resident in core application to keep track of programs and the operator's performance on individual and collective sustainment training modules . h. Network reach back to soldier's home station's Digital Training Management System for digital records . i. The core application will include adequate help capability supporting 24/7 education and training of units and individuals dispersed around the world. j. The training support capability will focus on the implementation and application of the we b-accessed functionality of role/dut y-based execution of networked joint surfac e-to-surface fires . k. At the unit and higher levels, AFATDS core application shall include capabilities facilitating trainin g on not just \"how\" the system works (\"knobology\" training), but more importantly, \"how\" the functionality of the applications can be employed collectively to achieve superior fires command and control capability with joint forces . l.

AFATDS 7.0 will support a fully role based operating construct. Based on the role of a user logging into the system, the system will present a customized interface to the operator along with access to a set of capabilities which pertain to that user\u2019s role. Association of users with roles will support the ability to be managed both locally and via enterpris e-level repositories such as active directory. AFATDS 7.0 will support the following default roles of: \u2212 Fire Directio n \u2212 Fire Contr ol \u2212 Fire Support \u2212 Universa l b. AFATDS 7.0 will allow for additional custom roles to be implemented that support their own unique user interface and capability access profiles. 6.2.13 Subtask 13 Host Based Security System (HBSS) AFATDS 7.0 will execute, with no degradation in speed of service or quality of service, on the HBSS . The Government will provide the awardee access to the Government facility with the HBSS environment. HBSS environment is located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland or Fort Hood, Texas . 6.2.14 Subtask 14 Service Based Back End The AFATDS 7.0 backend will be r e-architected and modernized to form a modern service based architecture. To accomplish this task the existing enterprise service technology within AFATDS will be replaced by a commo n COE derived message bus . All AFATDS business logic will be exposed as a web service to the common bus. Much of the business logic currently in AFATDS is not service based and will need to be converted to a web service. Approaches to be used to accompl ish this conversion will minimize the maintenance burden placed on future development efforts. Preferred approaches that may be considered are as follows : \u2212 Conversion to native web servic e \u2212 Web service wrappe r \u2212 Hybrid (some components are converted and othe rs are wrapped ) 6.2.15 Subtask 15 Streamlined Software Language Implementatio n AFATDS 7.0 will attempt to reduce the number of languages used in its construction. This includes both limiting the number of software languages used for implementing new portions o f the software that will be constructed under HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 25 of 217 AFATDS 7.0 as well as looking for opportunities to r e-write existing portions of the system with a common language. It is not the Government\u2019s intent to implement AFATDS 7.0 in its entirety with a single lang uage, but to reduce the variety of software languages used wherever practical to minimize the skillsets required to develop and maintain AFATDS 7.0 and future iterations . 6.2.16 Subtask 16 Mission Command and Computing Environment Standards AFATDS 7.0 is heavi ly interdependent on foundation products and services provided by COE. The Contractor\u2019s support of COE related activities will be essential to the overall success of AFATDS 7.0. The implementation solution developed by the Contractor will maximize to the fullest extent possible those services provided through COE. The Contractor\u2019s work will be synchronized with the overall COE schedule and accommodate COE specific design, integration and test events. 6.3 Task 3 AFATDS Document s All documents cited by reference in this SOO are contractually binding to the extent specified herein.
