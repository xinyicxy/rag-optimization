Basis for Contract Awar d This is a best value trad e-off source selection conducted in accordance with FAR 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented by the DFARS and the DARS. These regulations are available electronically at http://www.ditco.disa.mil/hq/aqinfo.as p and http://farsite.hill.af.mil . The Government will select the best overall offeror, based on integrated assessment of the ev aluation factors and subfactors described belo w. Contracts may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation\u2019s requirements (to include all stated terms, condit ions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors to represent the best value to the Government. The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives DISA the greatest confidence that it will best meet, or exceed, the requirements. b. Evaluatio n The technical proposal should include all information the offeror wants the Government to consider and evaluate regarding its compan y\u2019s ability to perform all required tasks and conform to all required terms and conditions. The best value determination will be based on the stated evaluation factors. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussion s with offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions or seek clarifications if the contracting officer determines they are necessary. In the event issues pertaining to a proposed contract cannot be resolved to the contracti ng officer\u2019s satisfaction, the Government reserves the right to withdraw and cancel the solicitation. In such event, offerors will be notified in writing. In the event a competitive range is established and the contracting officer determines that the nu mber of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition . c. Evaluation of Option s The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the base period.

The relative importance of each factor and subfactor is as follows: Within the technical/management factor, the subfactors are in descending order of importance. The su b-elements under each respective subfactor are of approximate equal importance to that subfactor. The technical/management approach factor is more important than the past performance factor. In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation fac tors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. Factor 2: Past Performanc e Factor 3: Small Business Participation Factor 4: OCI Mitigation Plan (if required ) Factor 5: Cost/Pric e HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 211 of 217 b. Technical/Management Facto r The technical/management evaluation will be evaluated using two distinct but related assessments: the technical/management rating and the technical/management risk rating. The offeror\u2019s technical solution will be rated separately from the risk associated with its technical approach. The technical rating evaluates the quality of the offeror\u2019s technical solution for meeting the Government\u2019s requirement. The risk rating considers the risk associated with the technical approach in meeting the requir ement. Technical evaluations shall utilize the ratings listed in Table 1 . Table 1. Technical Ratings Colo r Ratin g Descriptio n BLU E Outstanding Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal contains multiple strengths and no deficiencies . PURPL E Good Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thoroug h approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposa l contains at least one strength and no deficiencies . GREEN Acceptabl e Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequat e approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposa l has no strengths or deficiencies . YELLO W Margina l Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements . RED Unacceptabl e Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable. Deficiency is a material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessfu l contract performance to an unacceptable level. See FAR 15.001. Strengt h is an aspect of an offeror's proposal that has merit or exceeds specifie d performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance . Assessment of technical risk, which is manifested by the identification of weakness (es), considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased costs, degr adation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. Technical risk shall be rated using the ratings listed in Table 2 . HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 212 of 217 Table 2. Technical Risk Ratings Ratin g Descriptio n Low Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance.

Special contractor emphasis and clos e Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome difficulties . High Is likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Is unlikely to overcome any difficulties , even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring . c. Past Performance Facto r The technical/management approach factor is more important than the past performance factor. In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. The past per formance evaluation factor assesses the degree of confidence the Government has in an offeror\u2019s ability to supply products and services that meet users\u2019 needs, based on a demonstrated record of performance. Performance confidence is assessed at the overal l past performance factor level after evaluating aspects of the offeror\u2019s recent past performance. The information submitted shall reference only the offeror\u2019s, significant teaming partner\u2019s, or significant subcontractor\u2019s past performance on the submitte d effort, rather than the past performance of other contractors on the submitted effort. Past performance information shall be obtained from any other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information R etrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System, Electronic Subcontract Reporting System, or other databases; interviews with program managers, contracting officers, and fee determining officials; and the Defense Cont ract Management Agency. (1) Recency Assessmen t An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent. Recent contracts are considered to be efforts that the prime offeror and its teaming partners, joint venture or s ignificant subcontractors have performed within the past five years prior to original issuance of the solicitation, or for ongoing efforts the period of performance of which must have started at least nine months before the original proposal due date. Pa st performance information that fails this condition will not be further evaluate d. (2) Relevancy Assessmen t The Government will conduct an i n-depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained. For each recent past performance reference reviewed, the relevance of the work HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 213 of 217 performed will generally be assessed as compared to the technical/management factor. A relevancy determination of the offeror\u2019s past performance will be made based upon the contractor\u2019s previous experience in taking an existing DoD Tactical",

(3) Performance Quality Assessment (How well the contractor performed on the contract. ) The Government will consider the performance quality of recent and relevant efforts. For each recent and relevant past performance reference reviewed, the performance quality of the work performed will be assessed. The quality assessment consists of an i n-depth evaluation of the past performance questionnaire responses, PPIRS information, interviews with Government customers, and if applicable, commercial clients. It may include interviews with Defense Contract Management Agency officials or other sourc es known to the Government. The Government will use the following quality ratings when assessing quality of relevant contracts (DISA Supplemental Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.1 ( S-90)). Table 4.

As a result of the relevancy and quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an integrated performance confidence assessment rating. The resulting performance confidence as sessment rating is made at the past performance factor level and represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be e valuated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an \"Unknown Confidence\" rating for the past performance factor. The past performance factor will receive one of the performance confidence assessments described in the D oD Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.3. HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 215 of 217 d. Small Business Factor All proposals will be evaluated as to the extent o f participation of Small Business firms. The targets submitted in accordance with FAR 52.219- 24, and Section L paragraph 7.2.4 will be incorporated into and become part of the contract . The successful offeror will be required to provide reports on small business subcontractor participation in accordance with FAR 52.219 -25 in Section I of th e contract . If the offeror is other than a small business, the offeror's Small Business Subcontracting Plan submitted IAW FAR 52.219 -9 and Section L paragraph 7.2.4.2 shall also be evaluated to determine the extent to which the offeror identifies and commits to the participation of small businesses, whether as joint venture members, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor. Failure to submit such a plan will render the offeror ineligible for award. The Government will evaluate the small business participation and subcontracting plans to determine whether it is acceptable or unacceptable, using the rating and descriptions outlined in Table 6.
