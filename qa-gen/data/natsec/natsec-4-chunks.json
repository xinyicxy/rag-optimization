This Incentives Plan contains the processes, procedures, and incentive criteria that will be utilized to evaluate the contractor\u2019s performance throughout the course of the AFATDS 7.0 contract. This plan will be utilized for completing and determining i ncentive fee for all cost plus incentive fee Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs). The methodology behind Incentive Plan will be on a bilateral basis; however the Government will unilaterally make determinations on earned incentive fee based upon the contrac tor\u2019s performance in alignment to the criteria outlined in this plan. Government fee determinations are not subject to contractor disputes. 4. Concep t: The purpose of this Incentives Plan is to incentivize superior performance and motivate the contra ctor to successfully complete the overall objectives of this AFATDS 7.0 program while controlling cost, schedule, and risk. This Incentives Plan is built upon a performance based incentives methodology and is uniquely structured to align incentives with m easurable performance based outcomes. HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 85 of 217 5. Incentives Revisions/Optimization : As stated above, the methodology behind this Incentives Plan is performance based incentives/di s-incentives. Therefore, this plan will be updated as needed throughout the cont ract Period of Performance (PoP) in order to ensure it continues to effectively incentivize superior performance and result in",

Incentive Fee Allocatio n. This Incentives Plan is currently structured to incentivize contractor performance under the AFATDS Modernization and Development Baseline (CLIN 0001). The incentives for AFATDS Modernization and Development Target (CLIN 0002 ), will be subject to mutual agreement prior to exercising that option with the exceptio n of the Cost Control Incentive. At time of award, the contractor\u2019s target cost and target fee will be agreed upon for CLIN 0001, the contractor will be eligible to earn up to 15% fee/bonus pool on the target cost of CLIN 0001. With the exception of the provision fee listed in paragraph 7.1 for Incentive #1, the Government will perform an incentive review prior to paymen t of any fees. In incentive #2, the Government will review and make a final determination for the fee earned in performance of engineering releases and provide the results to the contracting officer. The contractor will then be notified of the approval t o invoice against the incentive CLIN . 7. Incentives . This contract will utilize a multiple incentive approach. Below are the incentives the contractor is eligible to earn during the PoP of CLIN 0001. All percentages will be rounded to the nearest tenth. 7.1 Incentive #1: Cost Control ( 0-5% Incentive) The Government will assess contractor cost control. At time of award, a target cost for CLIN 0001, based upon the contractor\u2019s proposal, will be finalized and documented in Section B of the contract. T he following calculation(s) will be utilized to determine fee on cost control performance as related to the target cost of CLIN 0001. Target Cost The contractor will be eligible for 2% fee for meeting target cost. Below is the formula to be utilized : *The above table is an example to show calculation/formula, amounts are subject to the agreed upon target cost. Cost Underru n Agreed Upon Target Cost 100.00 $ a Actual Cos t 100.00 $ b Underrun/Overru n - $ a - b = 0 Fee 2.00 $ b * .02 = c Full Contract Obligatio n 102.00 $ b + c = d Fee 2.0% c / b = fee Target Cost Calculatio n HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 86 of 217 The contractor is eligible to earn up to 30 cents on every dollar saved below the target cost in addition to the 2% target fee, with a not to exceed fee payment of up to 5% of the actual cost. Below is the formula to be utilized: Underrun Cost Calculati on Agreed Upon Targe t Cost $ 100.00 a Actua l Cost $ 92.00 b Underru n $ 8.00 a - b= c Underru n Fee $ 2.40 c * .3 = d Targe t Fee $ 2.00 a * .02 = e Full Contrac t Obligatio n $ 96.40 b + d + e = f Fee % on Cost 4.8% (d + e) / b = g *The above table is an example to show calculation/formula, amounts are subject to the agreed upon target cost. Cost Overrun There is no minimum guarantee of fee for the contractor under a cost overrun situation in this multiple incentive structure. The contractor is eligible to lose all fe e set aside for the cost control Incentive if they overrun by 120%, the ceiling of CLIN 0 001. Below is the formula to be utilized: *The above table is an example to show calculation/formula, amounts are subject to the agreed upon target cost. The contractor is eligible for provisional fee payments up to 1% of the agreed upon target cost, throughout the course of CLIN 0001 PoP as long as their Estimate at Complete (EAC), reported in Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) A001 \u2013 Integrated Progr am Management Report (IPMR) remains under or equal to the agreed upon target cost. If the contractor submits CDRL A001 submission that shows EAC has exceeded the agreed upon target cost all provisional fee payments will be suspended for the remainder of t he PoP. Provisional fee payments will not commence until after the Government has approved the Integrated Baseline Review (IBR). Once the contractor has held a successful IBR, they will be able to invoice fee in each voucher. The amount of fee available for invoicing in each voucher will be determined by taking the 1% of the agreed upon target cost and dividing it by the total number of Negotiated Target Cost 100.00 $ a 20% Overru n 120.00 $ b 0.1% Reduction Threshol d 1.00 $ (b - a) / 20 = c Actual Cost 110.00 $ d Actual Overru n 10.00 $ d - a = E Fee % on Cos t 1.00% .02 - (e / c) * .001 = f Actual Obligatio n 111.00 $ a *(1+ f )+ e Overrun Cost Calculatio n HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 87 of 217 remaining invoices to be submitted throughout the PoP of CLIN 0001. The contractor will then invoice this set amount o f fee in each invoice as long as their EAC remains under or equal to the agreed upon target cost. 7.2 Incentive #2: Performance ( 0-5% Gateway Incentive ) The contractor is eligible to earn up to 5% fee for delivering an AFATDS 7.0 baseline that opera tionally demonstrates it meets all baseline requirements as outlined in the AFATDS Software Requirements Specification (SRS) by the end of the CLIN 0001 PoP. The 5% fee allocated to this incentive is based upon the agreed upon target cost and does no t increase/decrease if the contractor realizes a target cost underrun/overrun. The fee available for this incentive will be set at time of awar d based upon the agreed upon target cost and available target fee. This incentive is a Gateway Fee incentive that b uilds off of initial and continued superior performanc e. The Government will",

In addition, if the con tractor sequentiall y meets the performance parameters of Gates 1, 2, and 3, they are eligible to earn a flat fee bonus. If the contractor does not successively pass Gates 1, 2, and 3 they forfeit their opportunity to earn the flat fee bonu s. Forfeiting t he flat fee bonus for not successively passing Gates 1, 2, and 3 does not impact the contractor\u2019s ability to earn fee at the Final Gate. In alignment with the Statement of Objectives, paragraph, 6.15, the contractor is to deliver engineer releases starti ng 120 calendar days after contract award and every 60 days thereafter. It is anticipated there will be a total of 10 engineering releases and 1 final release throughout the PoP of CLIN 0001. Therefore, the defined Gates for this incentive will focus on a subset of those engineering releases and are as stated below: Gate 1 - Engineering Release 3 Gate 2 - Engineering Release 6 Gate 3 - Engineering Release 9 Final Gate - AFATDS 7.0 Baseline Release Gate 1 (Engineering Release 3), Gate 2 (Engineering Release 6), and Gate 3 (Engineering Release 9) The contractor is eligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool for engineering releases 3, 6, and 9 (for a total of 30% of the available 5% fee pool i f each gate is achieved successfully). The contractor is eligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool at each Gate if the engineering release is delivered to the Government with n o Priority 1 or 2 errors; no exceptions. Priority levels are as define d in the AFATDS SRS. There is no limit on Priority 3 or 4 error rates. The data used to substantiate this performance assessment will be the contractor\u2019s testing data supplied in the applicable CDRL A035 \u2013 Software Test Description. Gates 1, 2, and 3 Successively Superior Flat Fee The contractor is eligible to earn 20% of the available 5% fee pool as a flat fee bonus for successively meeting Gates 1, 2, and 3, as defined above. Therefore, if the contractor delivers all thre e engineering releases (engineering releases 3, 6, and 9) with no Priority 1 or 2 errors, they are eligible for the flat fee bonus; no exceptions. As stated under Gates 1, 2, and 3, the priority levels are as defined in the AFATDS SRS. There is no limit on priority 3 or 4 error rates.

Contractor compliance with baseline requirements will be monitored by the Government via the documented verification and validation method for each requirement as outlined in the AFATDS SRS. The contractor is eligible to earn this fee pool whether or not they\u2019ve earned fee at the previous gateway evaluation s. Below is the formula to be utilized: Agreed Upon Target Cost 100.00 $ a Available Fee 5.00 $ b Gate 1 - Engineering Release 3 0.50 $ b * .1 = c Gate 2 - Engineering Release 6 0.50 $ b * .1 = d Gate 3 - Engineering Release 9 0.50 $ b * .1 = e Gate 1-3 Successive Gate Flat Fee Bonu s 1.00 $ b * .2 = f Fee Subtotal 2.50 $ c+d+e+f = g Final Gate - 7.0 Baseline Release 2.50 $ b * .5 = h Total Fee Earned 5.00 $ g + h = jPerformance Incentive Calculatio n *The above table is an example to show calculation/formula, amounts are subject to the agreed upon target cost. Note: If throughout the course of the contract, the Government approves a request for waiver or request for deviation on a baseline requirement, the contractor will not be subject to assessment on that requirement and full fee can continue to be earned v ia this incentive. 7.3 Incentive #3: Performance & Schedule (2% Flat Fee Bonus/Disincentive) This incentive is a Gateway Fee incentive that builds off of Incentive #2, Final Gate. The contractor is only eligible for this 2% Flat Fee Bonus if the co ntractor achieves the Final Gate under Incentive # 2, as it is not the Government intention to provide a bonus for providing a software baseline on time that does not meet baseline requirements. Incentive Therefore, if the contractor successfully clear s the Final Gate under Incentive #2 no later than 26 months after award, the contractor is eligible for a flat fee of 2% of the target cost. The 2% fee allocated to this incentive is based upon the agreed upon target cost and does no t increase/decrease if the contractor realizes a Target Cost Underrun/Overrun. The fee available for this incentive will be set at time of awar d based upon the agreed upon target cost and available target fee. Disincentive Conversely, if the contractor fails the final gate under Incentive #2 AND does no t deliver the AFATDS 7.0 baseline within 26 months of award, the contractor will pay the Government liquidated damages of 2% of the target cost. In a situation where the contractor fails the final gate of Incentive #2, but the Government decides to take acceptance of the AFATDS 7.0 baseline with known deficiencies within 26 months of award in order to HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 89 of 217 ensure the delivery of some capability to the Army Force, the contractor w ill not be assesse d for liquidated damages.
