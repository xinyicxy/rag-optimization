The security plan should inc lude implementation status, responsible entities, resources, and estimated completion dates. Security plans may also include, but are not limited to, a compiled list of system characteristics or qualities required for system registration, key securit y-related documents such as a risk assessment, privacy impact assessment, system interconnection agreements, contingency plan, security configurations, configuration management plan, and incident response plan. 6.12.2 Subtask 2 Categorize Syste m The Contractor wil l support Step 1 of the RMF, categorize the system. The system has the following RMF Categorization levels: Confidentiality: Medium; Integrity: High; Availability: High. The results of the system categorization will be documented in the SSP.

The Contractor will assist the Government in the selection of appropriate controls by identification of the security con trol baseline for the system, and documenting these in the SSP. Baseline controls and control overlays will be tailored for the system. Overlays may add or subtract security controls, or provide additional guidance regarding security controls, resulting i n a set of security controls applicable to the system that is a combination of the baseline and overlay. The combination of baselines and overlays address the unique security protection needs associated with the system. If necessary, control sets will b e tailored (modified) in response to increased risk from changes in threats or vulnerabilities, or variations in risk tolerance. Tailoring decisions must be coordinated with the Government, and aligned with operational considerations and the system environ ment. Security controls will be added or removed only as a function of specified, ris k-based determinations. Tailoring decisions, including the specific rationale (e.g., mapping to risk tolerance) for those decisions, will be documented in the security plan for the system. A monitoring strategy must be developed and documented as a syste m-level strategy for the continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of security controls employed within or inherited by the system, and monitoring of any proposed or ac tual changes to the system and its environment of operation. The strategy must include the plan for annual assessments of a subset of implemented security controls, and the level of independence required of the assessor (e.g., Information System Security M anager (ISSM) or Security Control Assessor (SCA)). The breadth, depth, and rigor of these annual assessments will be reflective of the security categorization of the system and threats to the system. Delivery of the security control selection will consis t of input into the eMASS system on SIPRNET . 6.12.4 Subtask 4 Implement Security Control s The Contractor will support Step 3 of RMF, implementation of security controls.

The Contractor will develop a plan to assess the security controls, known as the Security Assessment Plan. An assessment methodology can be found in NIST Special Publication 80 0-53A. The Contractor will assess the security controls in accordance with the security assessment plan and DoD assessment procedures. Assessment procedures are used to verify that a security control has been properly implemented. SRG and STIG compliance results will be documented and used as part of the overall security control assessment. This assessment process will be conducted any time there are updates or changes made that would impact the assessments. Assessments will be recor ded. If no vulnerabilities are found through the process of executing the assessment procedures, the security control is recorded as compliant. If vulnerabilities are found, the control is recorded as Not Compliant (NC) in the Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M), with sufficient explanation. Vulnerability severity values are assigned to all NC controls by the SCA as part of the security control analysis to indicate the severity associated with the identified vulnerability. As part of the overall asses sment prior to authority to operation, the Government will assign an assessment team.

The Contractors\u2019 assistance in developing the POA&M is vital to ensuring its maintenance throughout the system life cycle. Once posted to the POA&M, vulnerabilities will be updated after correction or mitigation actions are completed, but not removed. The associated trouble report will be documented and referenced in the POA&M.

Periodic assessment of the quality of security controls implementation against performance indicators, such as: security incidents; Government exercises; and o perational evaluations will be conducted by the Government, with the assistance of the Contractor. In addition, the Contractor will conduct internal assessments when system changes are being considered, to determine the risk of the changes. The Contractor must report any significant change in the security posture of the system, and recommended mitigations, immediately to the Government\u2019s ISSM.

As the DoD transitions from host based security compliance assessments to the utilization of enterprise tools, organizational processes and workflows will be required to adapt a new methodology in support of continuous monitoring efforts. Industry standards such as the Security Content Automa tion Protocols (SCAP) and ACAS are evolving in support of the mission to rapidly deploy content to any security compliance tool in a normalized format. The compliance tool is now becoming a weapon on the information security battlefield. The Contractor w ill develop a process for implementation of cybersecurity tools developed by DoD for monitoring compliance and assessing systems for vulnerability introduced in the development, implementation or maintenance phases of a system. This suite of tools will be deployed as the Continuous Monitoring Suite (CMS). The Contractor will deliver the CMS for use across PM MC Systems . CDRL A03 1 b. ACAS is an integrated software solution that is scalable to an unlimited number of locations. The solution\u2019s tiering ability will give DoD enhanced enterprise security while being easy to install and manage. It can be easily deployed via download to all DoD agencies \u2013 without the need to procure and install appliance devices. The ACAS product suite easily provides the require d automated network vulnerability scanning, configuration assessment, application vulnerability scanning, device configuration assessment, and network discovery it needs. Further, the product suite generates the required reports and data, with a centraliz ed console, and is SCAP compliant. The Contractor will include the ACAS software in the CMS. c.

The AFATDS is a mult i-service, automated Command, Coordination, Communication, and Computing system that provides automated fire support and coordination to all echelons, from Firing Unit through Theater Level, at Army, Marine Corps, Naval Firing Platfo rms, Navy Command and Amphibious Assault Ships, Air Force Operations Centers and Joint Command and Control Centers. AFATDS enables the Force Commander\u2019s guidance to be automatically applied in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan, execute, and deliver e ffects at all levels of command within the current and future force. AFATDS can automatically tailor the selection of fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters and offensive electronic warfare asset s) based on Commander\u2019s Guidance, thereby enabling maximum effective use of all available fire support assets across the full spectrum of conflict . It is the Government\u2019s objective to modernize the underlying AFATDS architecture, redesign the AFATDS fron t- end to a fully web and role based interface, integrate available common services made available through the Army\u2019s Common Operating Environment (CO E) and incorporate advanced embedded training technologies to aid in operator initiated system instruction and refresher training. This next generation version of AFATDS is referred to as AFATDS 7.0. 4. Objective s: To procure an innovative and stat e-of-the-art solution that provides a modernized backend AFATDS architecture; incorporates the common services provided by COE Version 3 (v3); implements role duty based functionality; and provides embedded computer based training . 5.
