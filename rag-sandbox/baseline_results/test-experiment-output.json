Technical/Management Facto r The technical/management evaluation will be evaluated using two distinct but related assessments: the technical/management rating and the technical/management risk rating. The offeror\u2019s technical solution will be rated separately from the risk associated with its technical approach. The technical rating evaluates the quality of the offeror\u2019s technical solution for meeting the Government\u2019s requirement. The risk rating considers the risk associated with the technical approach in meeting the requir ement. Technical evaluations shall utilize the ratings listed in Table 1 . Table 1. Technical Ratings Colo r Ratin g Descriptio n BLU E Outstanding Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal contains multiple strengths and no deficiencies . PURPL E Good Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thoroug h approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposa l contains at least one strength and no deficiencies . GREEN Acceptabl e Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequat e approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposa l has no strengths or deficiencies . YELLO W Margina l Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements . RED Unacceptabl e Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable. Deficiency is a material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessfu l contract performance to an unacceptable level. See FAR 15.001. Strengt h is an aspect of an offeror's proposal that has merit or exceeds specifie d performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance . Assessment of technical risk, which is manifested by the identification of weakness (es), considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased costs, degr adation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. Technical risk shall be rated using the ratings listed in Table 2 . HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 212 of 217 Table 2. Technical Risk Ratings Ratin g Descriptio n Low Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance.

High Is likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Is unlikely to overcome any difficulties , even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring . c. Past Performance Facto r The technical/management approach factor is more important than the past performance factor. In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. The past per formance evaluation factor assesses the degree of confidence the Government has in an offeror\u2019s ability to supply products and services that meet users\u2019 needs, based on a demonstrated record of performance. Performance confidence is assessed at the overal l past performance factor level after evaluating aspects of the offeror\u2019s recent past performance. The information submitted shall reference only the offeror\u2019s, significant teaming partner\u2019s, or significant subcontractor\u2019s past performance on the submitte d effort, rather than the past performance of other contractors on the submitted effort. Past performance information shall be obtained from any other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information R etrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System, Electronic Subcontract Reporting System, or other databases; interviews with program managers, contracting officers, and fee determining officials; and the Defense Cont ract Management Agency. (1) Recency Assessmen t An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent. Recent contracts are considered to be efforts that the prime offeror and its teaming partners, joint venture or s ignificant subcontractors have performed within the past five years prior to original issuance of the solicitation, or for ongoing efforts the period of performance of which must have started at least nine months before the original proposal due date. Pa st performance information that fails this condition will not be further evaluate d. (2) Relevancy Assessmen t The Government will conduct an i n-depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained. For each recent past performance reference reviewed, the relevance of the work HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 213 of 217 performed will generally be assessed as compared to the technical/management factor.

Any claim for loss or damage incurred during delivery shall be between the contractor and the carrier. The state accepts title only when goods are received regar dless of the F.O.B. point. The receiving agency will note all apparent damages in transit on the freight bill and notify the contractor. Discovery of concealed damages or loss will be reported by the receiving agency to the carrier and the contractor wit hin seven days of receipt and prior to removal from the point of delivery if possible. The contractor shall make immediate replacement of the damaged or lost merchandise or be in default of the contract. It shall be the contractor 's responsibility to file a claim against the carrier. If damage is to a small quantity, with the approval of the agency, the contractor may deduct the amount of damage or loss from his or her invoice to the agency in lieu of replacement. 15. Freight By signing an I .F.B. the bidd er certifies that the bid price(s) offered for F.O.B. destination include only the actual freight charges at the lowest and best rate and is based upon the actual weight of the goods to be shipped. Freight charges are, therefore, established for each indi vidual purchase. If a requirement is bid F.O.B. origin, the contractor shall prepay the charges and add the amount to the invoice. A copy of the freight bill should be attached to all invoices that include freight charges. In a solicitation specifying F .O.B. origin the state will consider freight cost in the evaluation of bids. 16. Termination for Default In case of default by a contractor for failure to deliver or perform in accordance with the contract specifications or terms and conditions, the County may procure the articles or services from other sources and hold the defaulting contractor responsible for any resulting additional purchase and administrative costs. The County will normally repurchase from the next low bidder or purchase competitively by resolicitation. If the repurchase results in increased costs to the County, a letter will be sent to the defaulted contractor required payment for additional costs. When repayment is requested, the contractor will be removed from future bidding until the repayment has occurred.

The approach will be assessed for quality and risk using distinct technical/management ratings and risk ratings.",

The relative importance of each factor and subfactor is as follows: Within the technical/management factor, the subfactors are in descending order of importance. The su b-elements under each respective subfactor are of approximate equal importance to that subfactor. The technical/management approach factor is more important than the past performance factor. In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation fac tors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. Factor 2: Past Performanc e Factor 3: Small Business Participation Factor 4: OCI Mitigation Plan (if required ) Factor 5: Cost/Pric e HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 211 of 217 b. Technical/Management Facto r The technical/management evaluation will be evaluated using two distinct but related assessments: the technical/management rating and the technical/management risk rating. The offeror\u2019s technical solution will be rated separately from the risk associated with its technical approach. The technical rating evaluates the quality of the offeror\u2019s technical solution for meeting the Government\u2019s requirement. The risk rating considers the risk associated with the technical approach in meeting the requir ement. Technical evaluations shall utilize the ratings listed in Table 1 . Table 1. Technical Ratings Colo r Ratin g Descriptio n BLU E Outstanding Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal contains multiple strengths and no deficiencies . PURPL E Good Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thoroug h approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposa l contains at least one strength and no deficiencies . GREEN Acceptabl e Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequat e approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposa l has no strengths or deficiencies . YELLO W Margina l Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements . RED Unacceptabl e Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable. Deficiency is a material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessfu l contract performance to an unacceptable level. See FAR 15.001. Strengt h is an aspect of an offeror's proposal that has merit or exceeds specifie d performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance . Assessment of technical risk, which is manifested by the identification of weakness (es), considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased costs, degr adation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. Technical risk shall be rated using the ratings listed in Table 2 . HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 212 of 217 Table 2. Technical Risk Ratings Ratin g Descriptio n Low Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and norma l Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome any difficulties . Moderat e Can potentially cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and clos e Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome difficulties . High Is likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Is unlikely to overcome any difficulties , even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring . c. Past Performance Facto r The technical/management approach factor is more important than the past performance factor. In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. The past per formance evaluation factor assesses the degree of confidence the Government has in an offeror\u2019s ability to supply products and services that meet users\u2019 needs, based on a demonstrated record of performance. Performance confidence is assessed at the overal l past performance factor level after evaluating aspects of the offeror\u2019s recent past performance. The information submitted shall reference only the offeror\u2019s, significant teaming partner\u2019s, or significant subcontractor\u2019s past performance on the submitte d effort, rather than the past performance of other contractors on the submitted effort. Past performance information shall be obtained from any other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information R etrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System, Electronic Subcontract Reporting System, or other databases; interviews with program managers, contracting officers, and fee determining officials; and the Defense Cont ract Management Agency. (1) Recency Assessmen t An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent. Recent contracts are considered to be efforts that the prime offeror and its teaming partners, joint venture or s ignificant subcontractors have performed within the past five years prior to original issuance of the solicitation, or for ongoing efforts the period of performance of which must have started at least nine months before the original proposal due date. Pa st performance information that fails this condition will not be further evaluate d. (2) Relevancy Assessmen t The Government will conduct an i n-depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained. For each recent past performance reference reviewed, the relevance of the work HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 213 of 217 performed will generally be assessed as compared to the technical/management factor. A relevancy determination of the offeror\u2019s past performance will be made based upon the contractor\u2019s previous experience in taking an existing DoD Tactical"

The past performance information forms and information obtained from other sources will be used to establish the degree of relevancy of past performance. The Government will use the following degrees of relevancy when assessing recent, relevant contracts (Department of Defense (DoD) Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.1) . Table 3. Past Performance Relevancy Rating s Ratin g Definitio n VERY RELEVANT Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. RELEVANT Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires . SOMEWHAT RELEVANT Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. NOT RELEVANT Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires . (3) Performance Quality Assessment (How well the contractor performed on the contract. ) The Government will consider the performance quality of recent and relevant efforts. For each recent and relevant past performance reference reviewed, the performance quality of the work performed will be assessed. The quality assessment consists of an i n-depth evaluation of the past performance questionnaire responses, PPIRS information, interviews with Government customers, and if applicable, commercial clients. It may include interviews with Defense Contract Management Agency officials or other sourc es known to the Government. The Government will use the following quality ratings when assessing quality of relevant contracts (DISA Supplemental Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.1 ( S-90)). Table 4. Past Performance Quality Assessmen t Quality Assessment Rating/Color Descriptio n HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 214 of 217 EXCEPTIONAL (E)/BLU E During the contract period, contractor performance meets or met contractual requirements and exceeds or exceeded many to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or su b-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective. VERY GOOD (VG)/PURPL E During the contract period, contractor performance meets or met contractual r equirements and exceeds or exceeded some to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or su b-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective. SATISFACTORY (S)/GREE N During the contract period, contractor performance meets or met contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or su b-element being assessed contained some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by t he contractor appear or were satisfactory . MARGINAL (M)/YELLO W During the contract period, contractor performance does not or did not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or su b-element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented . UNSATISFACTORY(U)/RE D During the contract period, contractor performanc e does not or did not meet most contractual requirements and recovery in a timely manner is not likely. The contractual performance of the element or su b-element contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineff ective . NOT APPLICABLE (N)/WHIT E Unable to provide a rating. Contract did not include performance for this aspect. Do not know . (4) Assigning Performance Confidence Assessment. As a result of the relevancy and quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an integrated performance confidence assessment rating. The resulting performance confidence as sessment rating is made at the past performance factor level and represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be e valuated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an \"Unknown Confidence\" rating for the past performance factor. The past performance factor will receive one of the performance confidence assessments described in the D oD Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.3. HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 215 of 217 d. Small Business Factor All proposals will be evaluated as to the extent o f participation of Small Business firms. The targets submitted in accordance with FAR 52.219- 24, and Section L paragraph 7.2.4 will be incorporated into and become part of the contract . The successful offeror will be required to provide reports on small business subcontractor participation in accordance with FAR 52.219 -25 in Section I of th e contract . If the offeror is other than a small business, the offeror's Small Business Subcontracting Plan submitted IAW FAR 52.219 -9 and Section L paragraph 7.2.4.2 shall also be evaluated to determine the extent to which the offeror identifies and commits to the participation of small businesses, whether as joint venture members, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor. Failure to submit such a plan will render the offeror ineligible for award. The Government will evaluate the small business participation and subcontracting plans to determine whether it is acceptable or unacceptable, using the rating and descriptions outlined in Table 6.
