Technical/Management Facto r The technical/management evaluation will be evaluated using two distinct but related assessments: the technical/management rating and the technical/management risk rating. The offeror\u2019s technical solution will be rated separately from the risk associated with its technical approach. The technical rating evaluates the quality of the offeror\u2019s technical solution for meeting the Government\u2019s requirement. The risk rating considers the risk associated with the technical approach in meeting the requir ement. Technical evaluations shall utilize the ratings listed in Table 1 . Table 1. Technical Ratings Colo r Ratin g Descriptio n BLU E Outstanding Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal contains multiple strengths and no deficiencies . PURPL E Good Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thoroug h approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposa l contains at least one strength and no deficiencies . GREEN Acceptabl e Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequat e approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposa l has no strengths or deficiencies . YELLO W Margina l Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements . RED Unacceptabl e Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable. Deficiency is a material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessfu l contract performance to an unacceptable level. See FAR 15.001. Strengt h is an aspect of an offeror's proposal that has merit or exceeds specifie d performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance . Assessment of technical risk, which is manifested by the identification of weakness (es), considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased costs, degr adation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. Technical risk shall be rated using the ratings listed in Table 2 . HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 212 of 217 Table 2. Technical Risk Ratings Ratin g Descriptio n Low Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance.

Special contractor emphasis and clos e Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome difficulties . High Is likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Is unlikely to overcome any difficulties , even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring . c. Past Performance Facto r The technical/management approach factor is more important than the past performance factor. In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. The past per formance evaluation factor assesses the degree of confidence the Government has in an offeror\u2019s ability to supply products and services that meet users\u2019 needs, based on a demonstrated record of performance. Performance confidence is assessed at the overal l past performance factor level after evaluating aspects of the offeror\u2019s recent past performance. The information submitted shall reference only the offeror\u2019s, significant teaming partner\u2019s, or significant subcontractor\u2019s past performance on the submitte d effort, rather than the past performance of other contractors on the submitted effort. Past performance information shall be obtained from any other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information R etrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System, Electronic Subcontract Reporting System, or other databases; interviews with program managers, contracting officers, and fee determining officials; and the Defense Cont ract Management Agency. (1) Recency Assessmen t An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent. Recent contracts are considered to be efforts that the prime offeror and its teaming partners, joint venture or s ignificant subcontractors have performed within the past five years prior to original issuance of the solicitation, or for ongoing efforts the period of performance of which must have started at least nine months before the original proposal due date. Pa st performance information that fails this condition will not be further evaluate d. (2) Relevancy Assessmen t The Government will conduct an i n-depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained. For each recent past performance reference reviewed, the relevance of the work HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 213 of 217 performed will generally be assessed as compared to the technical/management factor.

Loss or Damage in Transit Delivery by a contractor t o a common carrier does not constitute delivery to state agencies or political subdivisions. Any claim for loss or damage incurred during delivery shall be between the contractor and the carrier. The state accepts title only when goods are received regar dless of the F.O.B. point. The receiving agency will note all apparent damages in transit on the freight bill and notify the contractor. Discovery of concealed damages or loss will be reported by the receiving agency to the carrier and the contractor wit hin seven days of receipt and prior to removal from the point of delivery if possible. The contractor shall make immediate replacement of the damaged or lost merchandise or be in default of the contract. It shall be the contractor 's responsibility to file a claim against the carrier. If damage is to a small quantity, with the approval of the agency, the contractor may deduct the amount of damage or loss from his or her invoice to the agency in lieu of replacement. 15. Freight By signing an I .F.B. the bidd er certifies that the bid price(s) offered for F.O.B. destination include only the actual freight charges at the lowest and best rate and is based upon the actual weight of the goods to be shipped. Freight charges are, therefore, established for each indi vidual purchase. If a requirement is bid F.O.B. origin, the contractor shall prepay the charges and add the amount to the invoice. A copy of the freight bill should be attached to all invoices that include freight charges. In a solicitation specifying F .O.B. origin the state will consider freight cost in the evaluation of bids. 16. Termination for Default In case of default by a contractor for failure to deliver or perform in accordance with the contract specifications or terms and conditions, the County may procure the articles or services from other sources and hold the defaulting contractor responsible for any resulting additional purchase and administrative costs. The County will normally repurchase from the next low bidder or purchase competitively by resolicitation. If the repurchase results in increased costs to the County, a letter will be sent to the defaulted contractor required payment for additional costs. When repayment is requested, the contractor will be removed from future bidding until the repayment has occurred.

The relative importance of each factor and subfactor is as follows: Within the technical/management factor, the subfactors are in descending order of importance. The su b-elements under each respective subfactor are of approximate equal importance to that subfactor. The technical/management approach factor is more important than the past performance factor. In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation fac tors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. Factor 2: Past Performanc e Factor 3: Small Business Participation Factor 4: OCI Mitigation Plan (if required ) Factor 5: Cost/Pric e HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 211 of 217 b. Technical/Management Facto r The technical/management evaluation will be evaluated using two distinct but related assessments: the technical/management rating and the technical/management risk rating. The offeror\u2019s technical solution will be rated separately from the risk associated with its technical approach. The technical rating evaluates the quality of the offeror\u2019s technical solution for meeting the Government\u2019s requirement. The risk rating considers the risk associated with the technical approach in meeting the requir ement. Technical evaluations shall utilize the ratings listed in Table 1 . Table 1. Technical Ratings Colo r Ratin g Descriptio n BLU E Outstanding Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal contains multiple strengths and no deficiencies . PURPL E Good Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thoroug h approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposa l contains at least one strength and no deficiencies . GREEN Acceptabl e Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequat e approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposa l has no strengths or deficiencies . YELLO W Margina l Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements . RED Unacceptabl e Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable. Deficiency is a material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessfu l contract performance to an unacceptable level. See FAR 15.001. Strengt h is an aspect of an offeror's proposal that has merit or exceeds specifie d performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance . Assessment of technical risk, which is manifested by the identification of weakness (es), considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased costs, degr adation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. Technical risk shall be rated using the ratings listed in Table 2 . HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 212 of 217 Table 2. Technical Risk Ratings Ratin g Descriptio n Low Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and norma l Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome any difficulties . Moderat e Can potentially cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and clos e Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome difficulties . High Is likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Is unlikely to overcome any difficulties , even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring . c. Past Performance Facto r The technical/management approach factor is more important than the past performance factor. In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. The past per formance evaluation factor assesses the degree of confidence the Government has in an offeror\u2019s ability to supply products and services that meet users\u2019 needs, based on a demonstrated record of performance. Performance confidence is assessed at the overal l past performance factor level after evaluating aspects of the offeror\u2019s recent past performance. The information submitted shall reference only the offeror\u2019s, significant teaming partner\u2019s, or significant subcontractor\u2019s past performance on the submitte d effort, rather than the past performance of other contractors on the submitted effort. Past performance information shall be obtained from any other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information R etrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System, Electronic Subcontract Reporting System, or other databases; interviews with program managers, contracting officers, and fee determining officials; and the Defense Cont ract Management Agency. (1) Recency Assessmen t An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent. Recent contracts are considered to be efforts that the prime offeror and its teaming partners, joint venture or s ignificant subcontractors have performed within the past five years prior to original issuance of the solicitation, or for ongoing efforts the period of performance of which must have started at least nine months before the original proposal due date. Pa st performance information that fails this condition will not be further evaluate d. (2) Relevancy Assessmen t The Government will conduct an i n-depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained. For each recent past performance reference reviewed, the relevance of the work HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 213 of 217 performed will generally be assessed as compared to the technical/management factor. A relevancy determination of the offeror\u2019s past performance will be made based upon the contractor\u2019s previous experience in taking an existing DoD Tactical"

The past performance information forms and information obtained from other sources will be used to establish the degree of relevancy of past performance.

(3) Performance Quality Assessment (How well the contractor performed on the contract. ) The Government will consider the performance quality of recent and relevant efforts. For each recent and relevant past performance reference reviewed, the performance quality of the work performed will be assessed. The quality assessment consists of an i n-depth evaluation of the past performance questionnaire responses, PPIRS information, interviews with Government customers, and if applicable, commercial clients. It may include interviews with Defense Contract Management Agency officials or other sourc es known to the Government. The Government will use the following quality ratings when assessing quality of relevant contracts (DISA Supplemental Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.1 ( S-90)). Table 4.

As a result of the relevancy and quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an integrated performance confidence assessment rating. The resulting performance confidence as sessment rating is made at the past performance factor level and represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be e valuated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an \"Unknown Confidence\" rating for the past performance factor. The past performance factor will receive one of the performance confidence assessments described in the D oD Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.3. HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 215 of 217 d. Small Business Factor All proposals will be evaluated as to the extent o f participation of Small Business firms. The targets submitted in accordance with FAR 52.219- 24, and Section L paragraph 7.2.4 will be incorporated into and become part of the contract . The successful offeror will be required to provide reports on small business subcontractor participation in accordance with FAR 52.219 -25 in Section I of th e contract . If the offeror is other than a small business, the offeror's Small Business Subcontracting Plan submitted IAW FAR 52.219 -9 and Section L paragraph 7.2.4.2 shall also be evaluated to determine the extent to which the offeror identifies and commits to the participation of small businesses, whether as joint venture members, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor. Failure to submit such a plan will render the offeror ineligible for award. The Government will evaluate the small business participation and subcontracting plans to determine whether it is acceptable or unacceptable, using the rating and descriptions outlined in Table 6.

Therefore, the defined Gates for this incentive will focus on a subset of those engineering releases and are as stated below: Gate 1 - Engineering Release 3 Gate 2 - Engineering Release 6 Gate 3 - Engineering Release 9 Final Gate - AFATDS 7.0 Baseline Release Gate 1 (Engineering Release 3), Gate 2 (Engineering Release 6), and Gate 3 (Engineering Release 9) The contractor is eligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool for engineering releases 3, 6, and 9 (for a total of 30% of the available 5% fee pool i f each gate is achieved successfully). The contractor is eligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool at each Gate if the engineering release is delivered to the Government with n o Priority 1 or 2 errors; no exceptions. Priority levels are as define d in the AFATDS SRS. There is no limit on Priority 3 or 4 error rates. The data used to substantiate this performance assessment will be the contractor\u2019s testing data supplied in the applicable CDRL A035 \u2013 Software Test Description. Gates 1, 2, and 3 Successively Superior Flat Fee The contractor is eligible to earn 20% of the available 5% fee pool as a flat fee bonus for successively meeting Gates 1, 2, and 3, as defined above. Therefore, if the contractor delivers all thre e engineering releases (engineering releases 3, 6, and 9) with no Priority 1 or 2 errors, they are eligible for the flat fee bonus; no exceptions. As stated under Gates 1, 2, and 3, the priority levels are as defined in the AFATDS SRS. There is no limit on priority 3 or 4 error rates. The data used to substantiate this performance assessment will be the contractor\u2019s testing data supplied in the applicable CDRL A035 \u2013 Software Test Description. HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 88 of 217 Final Gat e The contractor is also eligible for 50% of th e available 5% fee pool if the final gate - AFATDS Baseline Release meets the baseline requirements outlined in AFATDS SRS. Contractor compliance with baseline requirements will be monitored by the Government via the documented verification and validation method for each requirement as outlined in the AFATDS SRS. The contractor is eligible to earn this fee pool whether or not they\u2019ve earned fee at the previous gateway evaluation s. Below is the formula to be utilized: Agreed Upon Target Cost 100.00 $ a Available Fee 5.00 $ b Gate 1 - Engineering Release 3 0.50 $ b * .1 = c Gate 2 - Engineering Release 6 0.50 $ b * .1 = d Gate 3 - Engineering Release 9 0.50 $ b * .1 = e Gate 1-3 Successive Gate Flat Fee Bonu s 1.00 $ b * .2 = f Fee Subtotal 2.50 $ c+d+e+f = g Final Gate - 7.0 Baseline Release 2.50 $ b * .5 = h Total Fee Earned 5.00 $ g + h = jPerformance Incentive Calculatio n *The above table is an example to show calculation/formula, amounts are subject to the agreed upon target cost. Note: If throughout the course of the contract, the Government approves a request for waiver or request for deviation on a baseline requirement, the contractor will not be subject to assessment on that requirement and full fee can continue to be earned v ia this incentive. 7.3 Incentive #3: Performance & Schedule (2% Flat Fee Bonus/Disincentive) This incentive is a Gateway Fee incentive that builds off of Incentive #2, Final Gate. The contractor is only eligible for this 2% Flat Fee Bonus if the co ntractor achieves the Final Gate under Incentive # 2, as it is not the Government intention to provide a bonus for providing a software baseline on time that does not meet baseline requirements. Incentive Therefore, if the contractor successfully clear s the Final Gate under Incentive #2 no later than 26 months after award, the contractor is eligible for a flat fee of 2% of the target cost. The 2% fee allocated to this incentive is based upon the agreed upon target cost and does no t increase/decrease if the contractor realizes a Target Cost Underrun/Overrun. The fee available for this incentive will be set at time of awar d based upon the agreed upon target cost and available target fee. Disincentive Conversely, if the contractor fails the final gate under Incentive #2 AND does no t deliver the AFATDS 7.0 baseline within 26 months of award, the contractor will pay the Government liquidated damages of 2% of the target cost. In a situation where the contractor fails the final gate of Incentive #2, but the Government decides to take acceptance of the AFATDS 7.0 baseline with known deficiencies within 26 months of award in order to HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 89 of 217 ensure the delivery of some capability to the Army Force, the contractor w ill not be assesse d for liquidated damages. A Government decision to assume greater risk and accept a delinquent AFATDS v7.0 final release does NOT result in the contractor being eligible"

The evaluation will also be used by DISA and other Government agencies as source selection information to support future Government procurements . H.5 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI)/OCI MITIGATION PLA N a. An organizational conflict of interest means that because of othe r activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a perso n has an unfair competitive advantage. The Government seeks to acquire unbiased advi ce and/or goods and services from offerors/contractors that are free from, or have mitigated, Organizational Conflicts of Interest , as defined in FAR 2.101, relating to this contract . b. In order for the Government to try to prevent an OCI relating to this contract, the parties to this contract agree that the contractor\u2019s future contracting with the Government may be restricted as outlined in FAR Subpart 9.5, if the offeror/ contractor and DISA are unable to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate actual or potential OCI before contract award . c. DISA will not automatically exclude a vendor from a competitive acquisition due to an actual or potential OCI. The Contracting Office is comm itted to working with potential vendors to eliminate or mitigate actual and potential OCI situations, without detriment to the integrity of the competitive process, the DISA mission, or the legitimate business interests of the vendor community . d. If the off eror or contractor is aware, or should have been aware, of an OCI before award of this contract or any task under against the contract, and does not fully disclose that conflict to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contractor for de fault. HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 69 of 217 e. The offeror or contractor, by submitting an offer and/or signing the contract, warrants that it is not now aware of any actual or potential OCI relating to this contract . f. After contract award, the contractor shall have an ongoing obligation to make \u201ca prompt and full disclosure\u201d to the Contracting Officer of any OCI that arises during the performance of the contract, as well as newly discovered conflicts that existed before contract award . g. The OCI Mitigation Plan shall become part of the resultant contract and the contractor shall update its OCI Mitigation Plan within 30 days of any changes to the legal construct of the organization, subcontractor changes, or significant management or ownership changes that would result in an actual or potential OC I under this contract . H.6 52.237- 9001 Enterpris e-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (eCMRA) Reporting. ENTERPRIS E-WIDE CONTRACTOR MANPOWER REPORTING APPLICATION (eCMRA) REPORTING (JAN 2015 ) The contractor shall ensure ALL contractor labor hours including subcontractor, at all levels/tiers, labor hours required for the performance of services provided under this contract are reported via a secure data collection site.

AFATDS 7.0 will support a fully role based operating construct. Based on the role of a user logging into the system, the system will present a customized interface to the operator along with access to a set of capabilities which pertain to that user\u2019s role. Association of users with roles will support the ability to be managed both locally and via enterpris e-level repositories such as active directory. AFATDS 7.0 will support the following default roles of: \u2212 Fire Directio n \u2212 Fire Contr ol \u2212 Fire Support \u2212 Universa l b. AFATDS 7.0 will allow for additional custom roles to be implemented that support their own unique user interface and capability access profiles. 6.2.13 Subtask 13 Host Based Security System (HBSS) AFATDS 7.0 will execute, with no degradation in speed of service or quality of service, on the HBSS . The Government will provide the awardee access to the Government facility with the HBSS environment. HBSS environment is located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland or Fort Hood, Texas . 6.2.14 Subtask 14 Service Based Back End The AFATDS 7.0 backend will be r e-architected and modernized to form a modern service based architecture. To accomplish this task the existing enterprise service technology within AFATDS will be replaced by a commo n COE derived message bus . All AFATDS business logic will be exposed as a web service to the common bus. Much of the business logic currently in AFATDS is not service based and will need to be converted to a web service. Approaches to be used to accompl ish this conversion will minimize the maintenance burden placed on future development efforts. Preferred approaches that may be considered are as follows : \u2212 Conversion to native web servic e \u2212 Web service wrappe r \u2212 Hybrid (some components are converted and othe rs are wrapped ) 6.2.15 Subtask 15 Streamlined Software Language Implementatio n AFATDS 7.0 will attempt to reduce the number of languages used in its construction. This includes both limiting the number of software languages used for implementing new portions o f the software that will be constructed under HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 25 of 217 AFATDS 7.0 as well as looking for opportunities to r e-write existing portions of the system with a common language. It is not the Government\u2019s intent to implement AFATDS 7.0 in its entirety with a single lang uage, but to reduce the variety of software languages used wherever practical to minimize the skillsets required to develop and maintain AFATDS 7.0 and future iterations . 6.2.16 Subtask 16 Mission Command and Computing Environment Standards AFATDS 7.0 is heavi ly interdependent on foundation products and services provided by COE. The Contractor\u2019s support of COE related activities will be essential to the overall success of AFATDS 7.0. The implementation solution developed by the Contractor will maximize to the fullest extent possible those services provided through COE. The Contractor\u2019s work will be synchronized with the overall COE schedule and accommodate COE specific design, integration and test events. 6.3 Task 3 AFATDS Document s All documents cited by reference in this SOO are contractually binding to the extent specified herein.

The Construction Manager shall identify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager with respect to the Project. Page 3 The Construction Manager will be required to hold a Construction Manager s\u2019 license (or applicable license) valid for the State of Wisconsin . 2.1 PRECONSTRUCTION PHASE Consultation The Construction Manager shall meet with the Architect and Owner to discuss such matters as procedures, progress, coord ination, and scheduling of th e work. The Construction Manager shall advise the Owner and the Architect on proposed site use and improvements , selection of materials, and building systems and equipment. The Construction Manager shall also provide recommendations consistent with the Pro ject requirements to the Owner and Architect on constructability; availability of materials and labor; time requirements for procurement, installation and construction; and factors related to construction cos t including, but not limited to: costs of altern ative designs or materials, preliminary budgets, life -cycle data, and possible cost reductions. The Construction Manager shall provide recommendations with regard to accelerated or fast -track scheduling, procurement, or phased construction. The Construction Manager shall take into consideration cost reductions, cost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction scheduling issues. Preliminary Cost Estimates Based on the preliminary design and other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate of Probable Cost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager suggests alternative materials and systems, the Construction Manager shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems. As the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design Documents, the Construction Manager shall prepare estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further development of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager agree on a Guaranteed Maximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s approval prior to the completion of each phase . The Construction Manage r shall inform the Owner and Architect when estimates of the Cost of the Work exceed the latest approved Project budget and make recommendations for corrective action. Guaranteed Maximum Price Proposal and Contract Time At a time to be mutually agreed up on by the Owner and the Construction Manager and in consultation with the Architect, the Construction Manager shall prepare a detailed line item Guaranteed Maximum Price Proposal for the Owner\u2019s review and acceptance. The Guaranteed Maximum Price in the pr oposal shall be the sum of the Construction Manager \u2019s estimate of the Cost of the Work and the Construction Manager \u2019s Fee for the Construction Phase as quoted in the Proposer\u2019s response to this RFP. The Construction Manager shall include with the Guarant eed Maximum Price proposal a written statement of its basis, which shall include the following: 1. A list of the Drawings and Specifications, including all Addenda thereto, and the Conditions of the Contract; 2. A list of the clarifications and assumptions made by the Construction Manager in the preparation of the Guaranteed Maximum Price proposal, 3. A statement of the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price, including a statement of the estimated Cost of the Work organized by trade categories or systems, allowances, contingency, and the Construction Manager \u2019s Fee; 4. A schedule of milestones for the comple tion and the anticipated date of Substantial Completion upon which the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price is based; 5. A Schedule of Value for each component of work to be undertaken; and 6. A date by which the Owner must accept the Guaranteed Maximum Pr ice. The Construction Manager shall meet with the Owner and Architect to review the Guaranteed Maximum Price proposal. Once a Guaranteed Maximum Price has been agreed upon by all parties, the Owner and Construction Manager shall execute the Guaranteed M aximum Price Amendment to the Contract. The Guaranteed Maximum Page 4 Price Amendment shall set forth the agreed upon Guaranteed Maximum Price with the information and assumptions upon which it is based and shall include a Schedule of Values . The Construction Manager shall guarantee that the Contract Sum shall not exceed the Guaranteed Maximum Price set forth in the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment, as it is amended from time to time. To the extent the Cost of the Work exceeds the Guaranteed Maximum Price, t he Construction Manager shall bear such costs in excess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price without reimbursement or additional compensation from the Owner. The Construction Manager will acknowledge that the Construction Manager is an experienced contractor a nd that (subject to Acts of God) the Project can be completed for Guaranteed Maximum Price. Subcontractors and Suppliers Those portions of the Work that the Construction Manager does not customarily perform with the Construction Manager \u2019s own personnel s hall be performed under subcontracts or by other appropriate agreements with the Construction Manager . The Owner may designate specific persons from whom, or entities from which, the Construction Manager shall obtain bids. Subcontractors must be located 50 miles or less from the Project site , unless a greater distance is approved by the Owner. The Construction Manager shall obtain at least three proposals from Subcontractors and from suppliers of materials or equipment fabricated especially for the Work and shall deliver suc h proposals to the Owner. The Owner shall then determine, with the advice of the Construction Manager and the Architect, which bids will be accepted. The Construction Manager shall not be required to contract with anyone to whom the Const ruction Manager has reasonable objection. If the Guaranteed Maximum Price has been established and a specifi c subcontractor or supplier (1) is recommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager , (2) is qualified to perform that portion of the Work, and (3) has submitted a proposal that conforms to the requirements of the Contract Documents without reservations or exceptions, but the Owner requires that another proposal be accepted,"

(End of provision) HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 206 of 217 Section M - Evaluation Factors for Awar d SECTION M SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWAR D M001 SOURCE SELECTIO N a. Basis for Contract Awar d This is a best value trad e-off source selection conducted in accordance with FAR 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented by the DFARS and the DARS. These regulations are available electronically at http://www.ditco.disa.mil/hq/aqinfo.as p and http://farsite.hill.af.mil . The Government will select the best overall offeror, based on integrated assessment of the ev aluation factors and subfactors described belo w. Contracts may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation\u2019s requirements (to include all stated terms, condit ions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors to represent the best value to the Government. The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives DISA the greatest confidence that it will best meet, or exceed, the requirements. b. Evaluatio n The technical proposal should include all information the offeror wants the Government to consider and evaluate regarding its compan y\u2019s ability to perform all required tasks and conform to all required terms and conditions. The best value determination will be based on the stated evaluation factors. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussion s with offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions or seek clarifications if the contracting officer determines they are necessary. In the event issues pertaining to a proposed contract cannot be resolved to the contracti ng officer\u2019s satisfaction, the Government reserves the right to withdraw and cancel the solicitation. In such event, offerors will be notified in writing. In the event a competitive range is established and the contracting officer determines that the nu mber of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition . c. Evaluation of Option s The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the base period. The offeror shall submit pricing for the base period and a ll option periods, including option pricing for an additional si x-month extension period that may be HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 207 of 217 authorized in accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.217 -8. See FAR 52.217 -8 which authorizes the Government to require continued performance of any services withi n the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. The pricing proposal should include a separate line item for the additional si x-month extension period IAW FAR 52.217 -8. The pricing for the additional si x- month extension period, IAW FAR 52.217 -8, applies to the Engineering Support Services and ODC CLINs only. These prices shall be identical to the proposed pricing in the six months prior to expiration of the base period, or the final option period, if option periods are present. The total evaluate d price will consist of the contractor\u2019s proposed price for the base period, all option periods, and the option pricing for the additional si x-month extension period. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are sign ificantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options. d. Number of Contracts to be Awarde d The Government intends to award one contract for the AFATDS 7.0 Modernization Program; however, the Government reserves the right to make no award at all . e. Rejection of Offers The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, contract terms and conditions. Additionally, the Government may reject proposals that are unrealistically"

Part B - Subcontractor/Teaming Partner Consent Letters executed by each teaming partner, joint venture partner and/or significant subcontractors authorizing the release of past performance information so the offeror can respond to such information. A sample consent letter is provided at HC1028 -16-R-0005, Section L, Attachment L-4. Part C - Client Authorization Letters for each identified effort for a commercial customer authorizing release to the Government of requested information on the offeror\u2019s performance. See HC1028 -16-R-0005, Section L Attachment L-5 for Client Authorization Letters . 5.3 Relevant Contract s a. Submit information using the format contained in Attachment L-1, Past an d Present Performance Information: Past Performance Information on no more than three recent (active within the past five years from the original issue date of this solicitation) contracts, this may include significant teaming partner\u2019s and/or significant subcontractor\u2019s past performance information submissions , that you consider most relevant in demonstrating you and your significant teaming partner\u2019s and/or significant subcontractor\u2019s ability to perform the proposed effort . The information submitted sh all reference only the offeror\u2019s, significant teaming partner\u2019s, or significant subcontractor\u2019s past performance on the submitted effort, rather than the past performance of other contractors on the submitted effort. b. In addition, the prime offeror s hall include information on a minimum of one recent contract performed by the prime offeror that you consider most relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort. Please see the maximum limitations set forth in subparagraph d below . c. Recent contracts are considered to be efforts that the prime offeror and its teaming partners, joint venture or significant subcontractors have performed within the past five years prior to original issuance of the solicitation, or for ongoing efforts the period of performance of which must have started at least nine months before the original proposal due date . d. The total of Past and Present Performance Information references will not exceed three pages per reference. Total page count for this Pa st Performance volume is annotated above in Table 2 -2. Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance. The Government uses degree s of relevanc y when assessin g recent , relevan t contracts in accordance wit h DoD Sourc e Selectio n HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 182 of 217 Procedures , paragraph 3.1.3.1, Table 4, exerted in Section M as Table 3, Past Performance Relevancy Ratings. The past performance evaluation team will consider the performance quality of relevant recent efforts for the second aspect of the past performance evaluatio n using Section M Table 4, Past Performance Quality Assessment. Finally, the past performance evaluation team will review this past performance information and determine the quality as it applies to performance confidence assessment. Performance Confiden ce Assessment ratings are identified in Section M, Table 5. 5.3.1 Specific Content Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the submitted past performance efforts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk. Merely having problems does not automatically equate to a limited or no confidence rating because the problems encountered may have been on a more complex program, or an offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the ability to overcome the problems encountered. The offeror is required to clearly demonstra te management actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified. Categorize the relevant information into the specific technical/management subfactors used to evaluate the prop osal. 5.3.2 Organizational Structure Change History Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection. As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this procurement. To f acilitate this relevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a \"roadmap\" describing all such changes in the organization of your company. A pamphlet or other commercial document describing such reorganizations may suffice. As part of this expl anation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/confidence assessment. Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provide d by the offerors, your \"roadmap\" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources . 5.4 Questionnaire s The offeror shall provide the Sample Questionnaire Cover Letter and Past Performance Questionnaire, found at HC1028 -16-R-0005, Section L, Attachments L-2 and L -3 respectively, to each of the customer POCs identified for each of the submitted past performa nce efforts. In order to expedite the assessment process, the offeror shall complete Sections I, II and III of the Past Performance Questionnaire for the convenience of the POC. The offeror shall not, however, complete any other section of the Past Perfo rmance Questionnaire. Once the questionnaires are completed by the POCs, the information contained therein shall be considered sensitive and shall not be released to the offeror. Early submission"

The modernization of the AFATDS baseline will satisfy the technical requirements for a transition to ne t-centric military operations, take advantage of we b-based networks to exploi t fires capabilities, and support the execution of joint critical operations. In addition, a modernized AFATDS will provide the operator an easier, more intuitive capability and feature embedded training to reduce the training burden on the operator as we ll as the unit.

The contractual performance of the element or su b-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective. VERY GOOD (VG)/PURPL E During the contract period, contractor performance meets or met contractual r equirements and exceeds or exceeded some to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or su b-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective. SATISFACTORY (S)/GREE N During the contract period, contractor performance meets or met contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or su b-element being assessed contained some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by t he contractor appear or were satisfactory . MARGINAL (M)/YELLO W During the contract period, contractor performance does not or did not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or su b-element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented . UNSATISFACTORY(U)/RE D During the contract period, contractor performanc e does not or did not meet most contractual requirements and recovery in a timely manner is not likely. The contractual performance of the element or su b-element contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineff ective . NOT APPLICABLE (N)/WHIT E Unable to provide a rating. Contract did not include performance for this aspect. Do not know . (4) Assigning Performance Confidence Assessment. As a result of the relevancy and quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an integrated performance confidence assessment rating. The resulting performance confidence as sessment rating is made at the past performance factor level and represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be e valuated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an \"Unknown Confidence\" rating for the past performance factor. The past performance factor will receive one of the performance confidence assessments described in the D oD Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.3. HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 215 of 217 d. Small Business Factor All proposals will be evaluated as to the extent o f participation of Small Business firms. The targets submitted in accordance with FAR 52.219- 24, and Section L paragraph 7.2.4 will be incorporated into and become part of the contract . The successful offeror will be required to provide reports on small business subcontractor participation in accordance with FAR 52.219 -25 in Section I of th e contract . If the offeror is other than a small business, the offeror's Small Business Subcontracting Plan submitted IAW FAR 52.219 -9 and Section L paragraph 7.2.4.2 shall also be evaluated to determine the extent to which the offeror identifies and commits to the participation of small businesses, whether as joint venture members, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor. Failure to submit such a plan will render the offeror ineligible for award. The Government will evaluate the small business participation and subcontracting plans to determine whether it is acceptable or unacceptable, using the rating and descriptions outlined in Table 6. TABLE 5 - Performance Confidence Assessment s Ratin g Descriptio n SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENC E Based on the offeror\u2019s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort . SATISFACTORY CONFIDENC E Based on the offeror\u2019s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. LIMITED CONF IDENCE Based on the offeror\u2019s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort . NO CONFIDENC E Based on the offeror\u2019s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. UNKNOWN CONFIDENC E (Neutral) No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror\u2019s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.

(3) Performance Quality Assessment (How well the contractor performed on the contract. ) The Government will consider the performance quality of recent and relevant efforts. For each recent and relevant past performance reference reviewed, the performance quality of the work performed will be assessed. The quality assessment consists of an i n-depth evaluation of the past performance questionnaire responses, PPIRS information, interviews with Government customers, and if applicable, commercial clients. It may include interviews with Defense Contract Management Agency officials or other sourc es known to the Government. The Government will use the following quality ratings when assessing quality of relevant contracts (DISA Supplemental Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.1 ( S-90)). Table 4.

As a result of the relevancy and quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an integrated performance confidence assessment rating. The resulting performance confidence as sessment rating is made at the past performance factor level and represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be e valuated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an \"Unknown Confidence\" rating for the past performance factor. The past performance factor will receive one of the performance confidence assessments described in the D oD Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.3. HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 215 of 217 d. Small Business Factor All proposals will be evaluated as to the extent o f participation of Small Business firms. The targets submitted in accordance with FAR 52.219- 24, and Section L paragraph 7.2.4 will be incorporated into and become part of the contract . The successful offeror will be required to provide reports on small business subcontractor participation in accordance with FAR 52.219 -25 in Section I of th e contract . If the offeror is other than a small business, the offeror's Small Business Subcontracting Plan submitted IAW FAR 52.219 -9 and Section L paragraph 7.2.4.2 shall also be evaluated to determine the extent to which the offeror identifies and commits to the participation of small businesses, whether as joint venture members, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor. Failure to submit such a plan will render the offeror ineligible for award. The Government will evaluate the small business participation and subcontracting plans to determine whether it is acceptable or unacceptable, using the rating and descriptions outlined in Table 6.

The Construction Manager shall take into consideration cost reductions, cost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction scheduling issues. Preliminary Cost Estimates Based on the preliminary design and other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate of Probable Cost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager suggests alternative materials and systems, the Construction Manager shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems. As the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design Documents, the Construction Manager shall prepare estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further development of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager agree on a Guaranteed Maximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s approval prior to the completion of each phase .

A schedule of milestones for the comple tion and the anticipated date of Substantial Completion upon which the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price is based; 5. A Schedule of Value for each component of work to be undertaken; and 6. A date by which the Owner must accept the Guaranteed Maximum Pr ice.
