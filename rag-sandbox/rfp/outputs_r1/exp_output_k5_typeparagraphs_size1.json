        "1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND  \nThe Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the \nhistoric Tribune Building  along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To \ndate, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making \nprocess.  As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new \neconomy and co mmunity that works well for all.  \nPage 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   ",

The selected Proposer will become the \nConstruction Manager  (CM).  ",
        "1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND  \nThe Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the \nhistoric Tribune Building  along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To \ndate, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making \nprocess.  As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new \neconomy and co mmunity that works well for all.  \nPage 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   ",
        " \nRequest for Proposal (RFP) \u2013 Tribune Building Project  \nIncourage Community Foundation,  Inc. (\u201cIncourage\u201d)  located in rural central Wisconsin, invites proposals  from \ninterested firms  for Construction Management services on the Tribune Building Project (located at 220 First \nAvenue South, Wisconsin Rapids).  ",
        "1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   "
