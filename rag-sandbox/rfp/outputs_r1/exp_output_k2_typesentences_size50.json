        "SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES   The Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2. 1. The Construction  Manager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2. 2. The Owner and Construction Manager   may agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of  the Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall  identify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project. Page 3  The Construction Manager  will be required to hold a Construction Manager s\u2019 license  (or applicable license)  valid  for the State of Wisconsin . 2. 1 PRECONSTRUCTION PHASE      Consultation   The Construction Manager  shall meet with the Architect and Owner to discuss such matters as procedures,  progress, coord ination, and scheduling of th e work. The Construction Manager  shall advise the Owner and the  Architect on proposed site use and improvements , selection of materials, and building systems and equipment. The Construction Manager  shall also provide recommendations consistent with the Pro ject requirements to the  Owner and Architect on constructability; availability of materials and labor; time requirements for procurement,  installation and construction; and factors related to construction cos t including, but not limited to:  costs of  altern ative designs or materials, preliminary budgets, life -cycle data, and possible cost reductions. The Construction Manager  shall provide recommendations with regard to accelerated or fast -track scheduling,  procurement, or phased construction. The Construction Manager  shall take into consideration cost reductions,  cost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction  scheduling issues. Preliminary  Cost  Estimates   Based on the preliminary design and  other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate  of Probable  Cost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager  suggests alternative materials and systems, the  Construction Manager  shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems. As the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design  Documents, the Construction Manager  shall  prepare  estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further  development of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager  agree on a Guaranteed  Maximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s  approval  prior to the completion of each phase . The Construction Manage r shall inform the Owner and Architect  when estimates of the Cost of the Work exceed the latest approved Project budget and make recommendations  for corrective action. Guaranteed  Maximum  Price  Proposal  and Contract  Time   At a time to be mutually agreed up on by the Owner and the Construction Manager  and in consultation with the  Architect, the Construction Manager  shall prepare a detailed line item  Guaranteed Maximum Price Proposal for  the Owner\u2019s review and acceptance. The Guaranteed Maximum Price in the pr oposal shall be the sum of the  Construction Manager \u2019s estimate of the Cost of the Work and the Construction Manager \u2019s Fee for the  Construction Phase as quoted in the Proposer\u2019s response to this RFP. The Construction Manager  shall include with the Guarant eed Maximum Price proposal a written statement of its  basis, which shall include the following:    1. A list of the Drawings and Specifications, including all Addenda thereto, and the Conditions of the  Contract;    2. A list of the clarifications and assumptions made by the Construction Manager  in the preparation of  the Guaranteed Maximum Price proposal,    3. A statement of the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price, including a statement of the estimated  Cost of the Work organized by trade categories or systems, allowances, contingency, and the  Construction Manager \u2019s Fee;    4. A schedule of milestones for the comple tion and the anticipated date of Substantial Completion upon  which the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price is based;    5. A Schedule of Value for each component of work to be undertaken; and   6. A date by which the Owner must accept the Guaranteed Maximum Pr ice. The Construction Manager  shall meet with the Owner and Architect to review the Guaranteed Maximum Price  proposal. Once a Guaranteed Maximum Price has been agreed upon by all parties, the Owner and Construction  Manager  shall execute the Guaranteed M aximum Price Amendment to the Contract. The Guaranteed Maximum Page 4  Price Amendment shall set forth the agreed upon Guaranteed Maximum Price with the information and  assumptions upon which it is based  and shall include a Schedule of Values . The Construction Manager  shall guarantee that the Contract Sum shall not exceed the Guaranteed Maximum  Price set forth in the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment, as it is amended from time to time. To the extent  the Cost of the Work exceeds the Guaranteed Maximum Price, t he Construction Manager  shall bear such costs in  excess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price without reimbursement or additional compensation from the Owner. The Construction Manager will acknowledge that the Construction Manager is an experienced contractor a nd  that (subject to Acts of God) the Project can be completed for Guaranteed Maximum Price. Subcontractors  and Suppliers   Those portions of the Work that the Construction Manager  does not customarily perform with the Construction  Manager \u2019s own personnel s hall be performed under subcontracts or by other appropriate agreements with the  Construction Manager . The Owner may designate specific persons from whom, or entities from which, the  Construction Manager  shall obtain bids. Subcontractors must be located 50 miles  or less from the Project site ,  unless a greater distance is approved by the Owner. The Construction Manager  shall obtain at least three  proposals from Subcontractors and from suppliers of materials or equipment fabricated especially for the Work  and shall deliver suc h proposals  to the Owner. The Owner shall then determine, with the advice of the  Construction Manager  and the Architect, which bids will be accepted. The Construction Manager  shall not be  required to contract with anyone to whom the Const ruction Manager  has reasonable objection. If the Guaranteed Maximum Price has been established and a specifi c subcontractor or supplier  (1) is  recommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager , (2) is qualified to perform that portion of the Work,  and (3) has submitted a  proposal  that conforms to the requirements of the Contract Documents without  reservations or exceptions, but the Owner requires that another  proposal  be accepted, then the Construction  Manager  may require that a Change Order be issued t o adjust the Guaranteed Maximum Price by the difference  between the bid of the person or entity recommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager  and the  proposal  of  the person or entity designated by the Owner. 2. 2 CONSTRUCTION PHASE     The Construction Phase shall commence upon the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment or  the Owner\u2019s issuance of a Notice to Proceed, whichever occurs earlier. Changes  in the Work   The Owner may, without invalidating the Contract, order changes in  the Work within the general scope of the  Contract consisting of additions, deletions or other revisions. The Architect  shall issue such changes in writing   and all change orders will be signed and acknowledged by Owner and Construction Manager . The Constru ction  Manager  shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the Contract Time as a result of changes in the Work. Change orders issued by the Owner subsequent to the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment  shall constitute adjustments to the  Guaranteed Maximum Price. Administration   Upon the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment, the Construction Manager  shall prepare and  submit to the Owner and Architect a construction schedule for the Work. The Construction Manager  shall  update the Owner in writing on the progress of the Project on a monthly basis indicating the percentages of  completion and other information required by the Owner. The Construction Manager  shall develop a system of cost control for the Work, inclu ding regular monitoring of  actual costs for activities in progress (compared to the Schedule of Values) and estimates for uncompleted tasks  and proposed changes. The Construction Manager  shall identify variances between actual and estimated costs  and repor t the variances to the Owner and Architect and shall provide this information in its monthly repo rts to  the Owner and Architect.",
        "Request for Proposal (RFP) \u2013 Tribune Building Project   Incourage Community Foundation,  Inc. (\u201cIncourage\u201d)  located in rural central Wisconsin, invites proposals  from  interested firms  for Construction Management services on the Tribune Building Project (located at 220 First  Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids). Submission Deadline:      Friday, February 13, 2015  at 4:0 0 p. m. CST      TABLE OF CONTENTS   1 Project Information   2 Scope of Services \u2013 Construction Manager \u2019s Responsibilities   3 Owner\u2019s Responsibilities   4 Insurance and Bonds   5 Proposal Format   6 Proposal Submittal   7 Proposer \u2019s Site Visit &  Q&A Session   8 Final Selection   9 Additional Information Requests      1. PROJECT INFORMATION     1. 1   ABOUT INCOURAGE   Established in 1994, Incourage Community Foundation is a nationally recognized leader in place -based  philanthropy and community change efforts. Incourage operates with a vision of a community that works well for  all people. To achieve this vision, values of equity, inclusion and opportunity are applied to all work, and to the  relationships Incourage fosters to accomplish its work. To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and  subcontractors who:     \uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius;   \uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work;   \uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work;   \uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place;   \uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to  corporate social responsibility. Incourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement  services under an AIA A133 contract  structure with  a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this   RFP (the  \u201cProject\u201d  and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) . The selected Proposer will become the  Construction Manager  (CM). 1. 2 DELIVERY METHOD   The delivery method for the Project is \u201c Construction Manager  at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133  based contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase. 1. 3 PROJECT BACKGROUND   The Project (tribunebuilding. org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf. org) purchased the  historic Tribune Building  along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To  date, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making  process. As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new  economy and co mmunity that works well for all. Page 2  To that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local  economy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational  rentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the  functional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow  human talent simultaneous to the local economy. The Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the  value and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure;  creativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship. 1. 4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT    In 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of  Consolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more  than a century. At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce. The dramatic  economic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency  would not serve their changed circumstances. The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in  determining their own identity. By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the  com munity\u2019s future. 1. 5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE   The Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets. Both the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are  already meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area. The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local  newspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design. The building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant. The revitalization will undoubtedly alter  the deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper  industry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an  accessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers. The  Tribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance. The Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids. \uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A. \uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C. All Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP. 1. 6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American  Institute of Architects)   Construction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction  Manager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and  then the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork  together in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a  Guaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately  from the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained. 2."

If the Architect or Construction Manager  suggests alternative materials and systems, the  Construction Manager  shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems. As the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design  Documents, the Construction Manager  shall  prepare  estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further  development of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager  agree on a Guaranteed  Maximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s  approval  prior to the completion of each phase . The Construction Manage r shall inform the Owner and Architect  when estimates of the Cost of the Work exceed the latest approved Project budget and make recommendations  for corrective action. Guaranteed  Maximum  Price  Proposal  and Contract  Time   At a time to be mutually agreed up on by the Owner and the Construction Manager  and in consultation with the  Architect, the Construction Manager  shall prepare a detailed line item  Guaranteed Maximum Price Proposal for  the Owner\u2019s review and acceptance. The Guaranteed Maximum Price in the pr oposal shall be the sum of the  Construction Manager \u2019s estimate of the Cost of the Work and the Construction Manager \u2019s Fee for the  Construction Phase as quoted in the Proposer\u2019s response to this RFP.

The Guaranteed Maximum Page 4  Price Amendment shall set forth the agreed upon Guaranteed Maximum Price with the information and  assumptions upon which it is based  and shall include a Schedule of Values . The Construction Manager  shall guarantee that the Contract Sum shall not exceed the Guaranteed Maximum  Price set forth in the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment, as it is amended from time to time. To the extent  the Cost of the Work exceeds the Guaranteed Maximum Price, t he Construction Manager  shall bear such costs in  excess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price without reimbursement or additional compensation from the Owner. The Construction Manager will acknowledge that the Construction Manager is an experienced contractor a nd  that (subject to Acts of God) the Project can be completed for Guaranteed Maximum Price. Subcontractors  and Suppliers   Those portions of the Work that the Construction Manager  does not customarily perform with the Construction  Manager \u2019s own personnel s hall be performed under subcontracts or by other appropriate agreements with the  Construction Manager .

        "Request for Proposal (RFP) \u2013 Tribune Building Project   Incourage Community Foundation,  Inc. (\u201cIncourage\u201d)  located in rural central Wisconsin, invites proposals  from  interested firms  for Construction Management services on the Tribune Building Project (located at 220 First  Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids). Submission Deadline:      Friday, February 13, 2015  at 4:0 0 p. m. CST      TABLE OF CONTENTS   1 Project Information   2 Scope of Services \u2013 Construction Manager \u2019s Responsibilities   3 Owner\u2019s Responsibilities   4 Insurance and Bonds   5 Proposal Format   6 Proposal Submittal   7 Proposer \u2019s Site Visit &  Q&A Session   8 Final Selection   9 Additional Information Requests      1. PROJECT INFORMATION     1. 1   ABOUT INCOURAGE   Established in 1994, Incourage Community Foundation is a nationally recognized leader in place -based  philanthropy and community change efforts. Incourage operates with a vision of a community that works well for  all people. To achieve this vision, values of equity, inclusion and opportunity are applied to all work, and to the  relationships Incourage fosters to accomplish its work. To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and  subcontractors who:     \uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius;   \uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work;   \uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work;   \uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place;   \uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to  corporate social responsibility. Incourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement  services under an AIA A133 contract  structure with  a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this   RFP (the  \u201cProject\u201d  and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) . The selected Proposer will become the  Construction Manager  (CM). 1. 2 DELIVERY METHOD   The delivery method for the Project is \u201c Construction Manager  at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133  based contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase. 1. 3 PROJECT BACKGROUND   The Project (tribunebuilding. org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf. org) purchased the  historic Tribune Building  along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To  date, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making  process. As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new  economy and co mmunity that works well for all. Page 2  To that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local  economy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational  rentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the  functional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow  human talent simultaneous to the local economy. The Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the  value and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure;  creativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship. 1. 4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT    In 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of  Consolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more  than a century. At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce. The dramatic  economic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency  would not serve their changed circumstances. The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in  determining their own identity. By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the  com munity\u2019s future. 1. 5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE   The Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets. Both the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are  already meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area. The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local  newspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design. The building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant. The revitalization will undoubtedly alter  the deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper  industry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an  accessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers. The  Tribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance. The Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids. \uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A. \uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C. All Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP. 1. 6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American  Institute of Architects)   Construction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction  Manager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and  then the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork  together in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a  Guaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately  from the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained. 2."

The Construction  Manager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2. 2. The Owner and Construction Manager   may agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of  the Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall  identify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project. Page 3  The Construction Manager  will be required to hold a Construction Manager s\u2019 license  (or applicable license)  valid  for the State of Wisconsin . 2. 1 PRECONSTRUCTION PHASE      Consultation   The Construction Manager  shall meet with the Architect and Owner to discuss such matters as procedures,  progress, coord ination, and scheduling of th e work. The Construction Manager  shall advise the Owner and the  Architect on proposed site use and improvements , selection of materials, and building systems and equipment. The Construction Manager  shall also provide recommendations consistent with the Pro ject requirements to the  Owner and Architect on constructability; availability of materials and labor; time requirements for procurement,  installation and construction; and factors related to construction cos t including, but not limited to:  costs of  altern ative designs or materials, preliminary budgets, life -cycle data, and possible cost reductions. The Construction Manager  shall provide recommendations with regard to accelerated or fast -track scheduling,  procurement, or phased construction. The Construction Manager  shall take into consideration cost reductions,  cost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction  scheduling issues. Preliminary  Cost  Estimates   Based on the preliminary design and  other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate  of Probable  Cost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager  suggests alternative materials and systems, the  Construction Manager  shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems. As the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design  Documents, the Construction Manager  shall  prepare  estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further  development of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager  agree on a Guaranteed  Maximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s  approval  prior to the completion of each phase . The Construction Manage r shall inform the Owner and Architect  when estimates of the Cost of the Work exceed the latest approved Project budget and make recommendations  for corrective action. Guaranteed  Maximum  Price  Proposal  and Contract  Time   At a time to be mutually agreed up on by the Owner and the Construction Manager  and in consultation with the  Architect, the Construction Manager  shall prepare a detailed line item  Guaranteed Maximum Price Proposal for  the Owner\u2019s review and acceptance. The Guaranteed Maximum Price in the pr oposal shall be the sum of the  Construction Manager \u2019s estimate of the Cost of the Work and the Construction Manager \u2019s Fee for the  Construction Phase as quoted in the Proposer\u2019s response to this RFP. The Construction Manager  shall include with the Guarant eed Maximum Price proposal a written statement of its  basis, which shall include the following:    1. A list of the Drawings and Specifications, including all Addenda thereto, and the Conditions of the  Contract;    2. A list of the clarifications and assumptions made by the Construction Manager  in the preparation of  the Guaranteed Maximum Price proposal,    3. A statement of the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price, including a statement of the estimated  Cost of the Work organized by trade categories or systems, allowances, contingency, and the  Construction Manager \u2019s Fee;    4. A schedule of milestones for the comple tion and the anticipated date of Substantial Completion upon  which the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price is based;    5. A Schedule of Value for each component of work to be undertaken; and   6. A date by which the Owner must accept the Guaranteed Maximum Pr ice. The Construction Manager  shall meet with the Owner and Architect to review the Guaranteed Maximum Price  proposal. Once a Guaranteed Maximum Price has been agreed upon by all parties, the Owner and Construction  Manager  shall execute the Guaranteed M aximum Price Amendment to the Contract. The Guaranteed Maximum Page 4  Price Amendment shall set forth the agreed upon Guaranteed Maximum Price with the information and  assumptions upon which it is based  and shall include a Schedule of Values . The Construction Manager  shall guarantee that the Contract Sum shall not exceed the Guaranteed Maximum  Price set forth in the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment, as it is amended from time to time. To the extent  the Cost of the Work exceeds the Guaranteed Maximum Price, t he Construction Manager  shall bear such costs in  excess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price without reimbursement or additional compensation from the Owner. The Construction Manager will acknowledge that the Construction Manager is an experienced contractor a nd  that (subject to Acts of God) the Project can be completed for Guaranteed Maximum Price. Subcontractors  and Suppliers   Those portions of the Work that the Construction Manager  does not customarily perform with the Construction  Manager \u2019s own personnel s hall be performed under subcontracts or by other appropriate agreements with the  Construction Manager . The Owner may designate specific persons from whom, or entities from which, the  Construction Manager  shall obtain bids. Subcontractors must be located 50 miles  or less from the Project site ,  unless a greater distance is approved by the Owner. The Construction Manager  shall obtain at least three  proposals from Subcontractors and from suppliers of materials or equipment fabricated especially for the Work  and shall deliver suc h proposals  to the Owner. The Owner shall then determine, with the advice of the  Construction Manager  and the Architect, which bids will be accepted. The Construction Manager  shall not be  required to contract with anyone to whom the Const ruction Manager  has reasonable objection. If the Guaranteed Maximum Price has been established and a specifi c subcontractor or supplier  (1) is  recommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager , (2) is qualified to perform that portion of the Work,  and (3) has submitted a  proposal  that conforms to the requirements of the Contract Documents without  reservations or exceptions, but the Owner requires that another  proposal  be accepted, then the Construction  Manager  may require that a Change Order be issued t o adjust the Guaranteed Maximum Price by the difference  between the bid of the person or entity recommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager  and the  proposal  of  the person or entity designated by the Owner. 2. 2 CONSTRUCTION PHASE     The Construction Phase shall commence upon the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment or  the Owner\u2019s issuance of a Notice to Proceed, whichever occurs earlier. Changes  in the Work   The Owner may, without invalidating the Contract, order changes in  the Work within the general scope of the  Contract consisting of additions, deletions or other revisions. The Architect  shall issue such changes in writing   and all change orders will be signed and acknowledged by Owner and Construction Manager . The Constru ction  Manager  shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the Contract Time as a result of changes in the Work. Change orders issued by the Owner subsequent to the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment  shall constitute adjustments to the  Guaranteed Maximum Price.

The Construction  Manager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2. 2. The Owner and Construction Manager   may agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of  the Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall  identify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project. Page 3  The Construction Manager  will be required to hold a Construction Manager s\u2019 license  (or applicable license)  valid  for the State of Wisconsin . 2. 1 PRECONSTRUCTION PHASE      Consultation   The Construction Manager  shall meet with the Architect and Owner to discuss such matters as procedures,  progress, coord ination, and scheduling of th e work. The Construction Manager  shall advise the Owner and the  Architect on proposed site use and improvements , selection of materials, and building systems and equipment. The Construction Manager  shall also provide recommendations consistent with the Pro ject requirements to the  Owner and Architect on constructability; availability of materials and labor; time requirements for procurement,  installation and construction; and factors related to construction cos t including, but not limited to:  costs of  altern ative designs or materials, preliminary budgets, life -cycle data, and possible cost reductions. The Construction Manager  shall provide recommendations with regard to accelerated or fast -track scheduling,  procurement, or phased construction. The Construction Manager  shall take into consideration cost reductions,  cost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction  scheduling issues. Preliminary  Cost  Estimates   Based on the preliminary design and  other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate  of Probable  Cost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager  suggests alternative materials and systems, the  Construction Manager  shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems. As the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design  Documents, the Construction Manager  shall  prepare  estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further  development of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager  agree on a Guaranteed  Maximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s  approval  prior to the completion of each phase . The Construction Manage r shall inform the Owner and Architect  when estimates of the Cost of the Work exceed the latest approved Project budget and make recommendations  for corrective action. Guaranteed  Maximum  Price  Proposal  and Contract  Time   At a time to be mutually agreed up on by the Owner and the Construction Manager  and in consultation with the  Architect, the Construction Manager  shall prepare a detailed line item  Guaranteed Maximum Price Proposal for  the Owner\u2019s review and acceptance. The Guaranteed Maximum Price in the pr oposal shall be the sum of the  Construction Manager \u2019s estimate of the Cost of the Work and the Construction Manager \u2019s Fee for the  Construction Phase as quoted in the Proposer\u2019s response to this RFP. The Construction Manager  shall include with the Guarant eed Maximum Price proposal a written statement of its  basis, which shall include the following:    1. A list of the Drawings and Specifications, including all Addenda thereto, and the Conditions of the  Contract;    2. A list of the clarifications and assumptions made by the Construction Manager  in the preparation of  the Guaranteed Maximum Price proposal,    3. A statement of the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price, including a statement of the estimated  Cost of the Work organized by trade categories or systems, allowances, contingency, and the  Construction Manager \u2019s Fee;    4.

A Schedule of Value for each component of work to be undertaken; and   6. A date by which the Owner must accept the Guaranteed Maximum Pr ice. The Construction Manager  shall meet with the Owner and Architect to review the Guaranteed Maximum Price  proposal. Once a Guaranteed Maximum Price has been agreed upon by all parties, the Owner and Construction  Manager  shall execute the Guaranteed M aximum Price Amendment to the Contract. The Guaranteed Maximum Page 4  Price Amendment shall set forth the agreed upon Guaranteed Maximum Price with the information and  assumptions upon which it is based  and shall include a Schedule of Values . The Construction Manager  shall guarantee that the Contract Sum shall not exceed the Guaranteed Maximum  Price set forth in the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment, as it is amended from time to time. To the extent  the Cost of the Work exceeds the Guaranteed Maximum Price, t he Construction Manager  shall bear such costs in  excess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price without reimbursement or additional compensation from the Owner. The Construction Manager will acknowledge that the Construction Manager is an experienced contractor a nd  that (subject to Acts of God) the Project can be completed for Guaranteed Maximum Price. Subcontractors  and Suppliers   Those portions of the Work that the Construction Manager  does not customarily perform with the Construction  Manager \u2019s own personnel s hall be performed under subcontracts or by other appropriate agreements with the  Construction Manager . The Owner may designate specific persons from whom, or entities from which, the  Construction Manager  shall obtain bids.

The Construction Manager  shall obtain at least three  proposals from Subcontractors and from suppliers of materials or equipment fabricated especially for the Work  and shall deliver suc h proposals  to the Owner. The Owner shall then determine, with the advice of the  Construction Manager  and the Architect, which bids will be accepted. The Construction Manager  shall not be  required to contract with anyone to whom the Const ruction Manager  has reasonable objection. If the Guaranteed Maximum Price has been established and a specifi c subcontractor or supplier  (1) is  recommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager , (2) is qualified to perform that portion of the Work,  and (3) has submitted a  proposal  that conforms to the requirements of the Contract Documents without  reservations or exceptions, but the Owner requires that another  proposal  be accepted, then the Construction  Manager  may require that a Change Order be issued t o adjust the Guaranteed Maximum Price by the difference  between the bid of the person or entity recommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager  and the  proposal  of  the person or entity designated by the Owner. 2. 2 CONSTRUCTION PHASE     The Construction Phase shall commence upon the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment or  the Owner\u2019s issuance of a Notice to Proceed, whichever occurs earlier. Changes  in the Work   The Owner may, without invalidating the Contract, order changes in  the Work within the general scope of the  Contract consisting of additions, deletions or other revisions. The Architect  shall issue such changes in writing   and all change orders will be signed and acknowledged by Owner and Construction Manager . The Constru ction  Manager  shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the Contract Time as a result of changes in the Work.

The Construction Manager  shall identify variances between actual and estimated costs  and repor t the variances to the Owner and Architect and shall provide this information in its monthly repo rts to  the Owner and Architect.",
        "Request for Proposal (RFP) \u2013 Tribune Building Project   Incourage Community Foundation,  Inc. (\u201cIncourage\u201d)  located in rural central Wisconsin, invites proposals  from  interested firms  for Construction Management services on the Tribune Building Project (located at 220 First  Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids). Submission Deadline:      Friday, February 13, 2015  at 4:0 0 p. m. CST      TABLE OF CONTENTS   1 Project Information   2 Scope of Services \u2013 Construction Manager \u2019s Responsibilities   3 Owner\u2019s Responsibilities   4 Insurance and Bonds   5 Proposal Format   6 Proposal Submittal   7 Proposer \u2019s Site Visit &  Q&A Session   8 Final Selection   9 Additional Information Requests      1. PROJECT INFORMATION     1. 1   ABOUT INCOURAGE   Established in 1994, Incourage Community Foundation is a nationally recognized leader in place -based  philanthropy and community change efforts. Incourage operates with a vision of a community that works well for  all people. To achieve this vision, values of equity, inclusion and opportunity are applied to all work, and to the  relationships Incourage fosters to accomplish its work. To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and  subcontractors who:     \uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius;   \uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work;   \uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work;   \uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place;   \uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to  corporate social responsibility. Incourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement  services under an AIA A133 contract  structure with  a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this   RFP (the  \u201cProject\u201d  and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) . The selected Proposer will become the  Construction Manager  (CM). 1. 2 DELIVERY METHOD   The delivery method for the Project is \u201c Construction Manager  at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133  based contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase. 1. 3 PROJECT BACKGROUND   The Project (tribunebuilding. org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf. org) purchased the  historic Tribune Building  along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To  date, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making  process. As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new  economy and co mmunity that works well for all. Page 2  To that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local  economy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational  rentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the  functional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow  human talent simultaneous to the local economy. The Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the  value and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure;  creativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship. 1. 4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT    In 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of  Consolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more  than a century. At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce. The dramatic  economic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency  would not serve their changed circumstances. The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in  determining their own identity. By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the  com munity\u2019s future. 1. 5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE   The Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets. Both the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are  already meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area. The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local  newspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design. The building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant. The revitalization will undoubtedly alter  the deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper  industry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an  accessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers. The  Tribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance. The Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids. \uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A. \uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C. All Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP. 1. 6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American  Institute of Architects)   Construction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction  Manager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and  then the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork  together in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a  Guaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately  from the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained. 2."

The Construction  Manager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2. 2. The Owner and Construction Manager   may agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of  the Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall  identify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project. Page 3  The Construction Manager  will be required to hold a Construction Manager s\u2019 license  (or applicable license)  valid  for the State of Wisconsin . 2. 1 PRECONSTRUCTION PHASE      Consultation   The Construction Manager  shall meet with the Architect and Owner to discuss such matters as procedures,  progress, coord ination, and scheduling of th e work. The Construction Manager  shall advise the Owner and the  Architect on proposed site use and improvements , selection of materials, and building systems and equipment. The Construction Manager  shall also provide recommendations consistent with the Pro ject requirements to the  Owner and Architect on constructability; availability of materials and labor; time requirements for procurement,  installation and construction; and factors related to construction cos t including, but not limited to:  costs of  altern ative designs or materials, preliminary budgets, life -cycle data, and possible cost reductions. The Construction Manager  shall provide recommendations with regard to accelerated or fast -track scheduling,  procurement, or phased construction. The Construction Manager  shall take into consideration cost reductions,  cost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction  scheduling issues. Preliminary  Cost  Estimates   Based on the preliminary design and  other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate  of Probable  Cost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager  suggests alternative materials and systems, the  Construction Manager  shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems. As the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design  Documents, the Construction Manager  shall  prepare  estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further  development of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager  agree on a Guaranteed  Maximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s  approval  prior to the completion of each phase . The Construction Manage r shall inform the Owner and Architect  when estimates of the Cost of the Work exceed the latest approved Project budget and make recommendations  for corrective action. Guaranteed  Maximum  Price  Proposal  and Contract  Time   At a time to be mutually agreed up on by the Owner and the Construction Manager  and in consultation with the  Architect, the Construction Manager  shall prepare a detailed line item  Guaranteed Maximum Price Proposal for  the Owner\u2019s review and acceptance. The Guaranteed Maximum Price in the pr oposal shall be the sum of the  Construction Manager \u2019s estimate of the Cost of the Work and the Construction Manager \u2019s Fee for the  Construction Phase as quoted in the Proposer\u2019s response to this RFP. The Construction Manager  shall include with the Guarant eed Maximum Price proposal a written statement of its  basis, which shall include the following:    1. A list of the Drawings and Specifications, including all Addenda thereto, and the Conditions of the  Contract;    2. A list of the clarifications and assumptions made by the Construction Manager  in the preparation of  the Guaranteed Maximum Price proposal,    3. A statement of the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price, including a statement of the estimated  Cost of the Work organized by trade categories or systems, allowances, contingency, and the  Construction Manager \u2019s Fee;    4. A schedule of milestones for the comple tion and the anticipated date of Substantial Completion upon  which the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price is based;    5. A Schedule of Value for each component of work to be undertaken; and   6. A date by which the Owner must accept the Guaranteed Maximum Pr ice. The Construction Manager  shall meet with the Owner and Architect to review the Guaranteed Maximum Price  proposal. Once a Guaranteed Maximum Price has been agreed upon by all parties, the Owner and Construction  Manager  shall execute the Guaranteed M aximum Price Amendment to the Contract. The Guaranteed Maximum Page 4  Price Amendment shall set forth the agreed upon Guaranteed Maximum Price with the information and  assumptions upon which it is based  and shall include a Schedule of Values . The Construction Manager  shall guarantee that the Contract Sum shall not exceed the Guaranteed Maximum  Price set forth in the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment, as it is amended from time to time. To the extent  the Cost of the Work exceeds the Guaranteed Maximum Price, t he Construction Manager  shall bear such costs in  excess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price without reimbursement or additional compensation from the Owner. The Construction Manager will acknowledge that the Construction Manager is an experienced contractor a nd  that (subject to Acts of God) the Project can be completed for Guaranteed Maximum Price. Subcontractors  and Suppliers   Those portions of the Work that the Construction Manager  does not customarily perform with the Construction  Manager \u2019s own personnel s hall be performed under subcontracts or by other appropriate agreements with the  Construction Manager . The Owner may designate specific persons from whom, or entities from which, the  Construction Manager  shall obtain bids. Subcontractors must be located 50 miles  or less from the Project site ,  unless a greater distance is approved by the Owner. The Construction Manager  shall obtain at least three  proposals from Subcontractors and from suppliers of materials or equipment fabricated especially for the Work  and shall deliver suc h proposals  to the Owner. The Owner shall then determine, with the advice of the  Construction Manager  and the Architect, which bids will be accepted. The Construction Manager  shall not be  required to contract with anyone to whom the Const ruction Manager  has reasonable objection. If the Guaranteed Maximum Price has been established and a specifi c subcontractor or supplier  (1) is  recommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager , (2) is qualified to perform that portion of the Work,  and (3) has submitted a  proposal  that conforms to the requirements of the Contract Documents without  reservations or exceptions, but the Owner requires that another  proposal  be accepted, then the Construction  Manager  may require that a Change Order be issued t o adjust the Guaranteed Maximum Price by the difference  between the bid of the person or entity recommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager  and the  proposal  of  the person or entity designated by the Owner. 2. 2 CONSTRUCTION PHASE     The Construction Phase shall commence upon the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment or  the Owner\u2019s issuance of a Notice to Proceed, whichever occurs earlier. Changes  in the Work   The Owner may, without invalidating the Contract, order changes in  the Work within the general scope of the  Contract consisting of additions, deletions or other revisions. The Architect  shall issue such changes in writing   and all change orders will be signed and acknowledged by Owner and Construction Manager . The Constru ction  Manager  shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the Contract Time as a result of changes in the Work. Change orders issued by the Owner subsequent to the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment  shall constitute adjustments to the  Guaranteed Maximum Price. Administration   Upon the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment, the Construction Manager  shall prepare and  submit to the Owner and Architect a construction schedule for the Work. The Construction Manager  shall  update the Owner in writing on the progress of the Project on a monthly basis indicating the percentages of  completion and other information required by the Owner. The Construction Manager  shall develop a system of cost control for the Work, inclu ding regular monitoring of  actual costs for activities in progress (compared to the Schedule of Values) and estimates for uncompleted tasks  and proposed changes. The Construction Manager  shall identify variances between actual and estimated costs  and repor t the variances to the Owner and Architect and shall provide this information in its monthly repo rts to  the Owner and Architect.",
        "Request for Proposal (RFP) \u2013 Tribune Building Project   Incourage Community Foundation,  Inc. (\u201cIncourage\u201d)  located in rural central Wisconsin, invites proposals  from  interested firms  for Construction Management services on the Tribune Building Project (located at 220 First  Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids). Submission Deadline:      Friday, February 13, 2015  at 4:0 0 p. m. CST      TABLE OF CONTENTS   1 Project Information   2 Scope of Services \u2013 Construction Manager \u2019s Responsibilities   3 Owner\u2019s Responsibilities   4 Insurance and Bonds   5 Proposal Format   6 Proposal Submittal   7 Proposer \u2019s Site Visit &  Q&A Session   8 Final Selection   9 Additional Information Requests      1. PROJECT INFORMATION     1. 1   ABOUT INCOURAGE   Established in 1994, Incourage Community Foundation is a nationally recognized leader in place -based  philanthropy and community change efforts. Incourage operates with a vision of a community that works well for  all people. To achieve this vision, values of equity, inclusion and opportunity are applied to all work, and to the  relationships Incourage fosters to accomplish its work. To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and  subcontractors who:     \uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius;   \uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work;   \uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work;   \uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place;   \uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to  corporate social responsibility. Incourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement  services under an AIA A133 contract  structure with  a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this   RFP (the  \u201cProject\u201d  and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) . The selected Proposer will become the  Construction Manager  (CM). 1. 2 DELIVERY METHOD   The delivery method for the Project is \u201c Construction Manager  at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133  based contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase. 1. 3 PROJECT BACKGROUND   The Project (tribunebuilding. org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf. org) purchased the  historic Tribune Building  along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To  date, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making  process. As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new  economy and co mmunity that works well for all. Page 2  To that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local  economy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational  rentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the  functional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow  human talent simultaneous to the local economy. The Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the  value and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure;  creativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship. 1. 4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT    In 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of  Consolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more  than a century. At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce. The dramatic  economic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency  would not serve their changed circumstances. The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in  determining their own identity. By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the  com munity\u2019s future. 1. 5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE   The Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets. Both the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are  already meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area. The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local  newspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design. The building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant. The revitalization will undoubtedly alter  the deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper  industry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an  accessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers. The  Tribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance. The Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids. \uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A. \uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C. All Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP. 1. 6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American  Institute of Architects)   Construction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction  Manager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and  then the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork  together in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a  Guaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately  from the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained. 2."

Background . The AFATDS is a mult i-service, automated Command, Coordination, Communication, and  Computing system that provides automated fire support and coordination to all echelons, from Firing Unit through   Theater Level, at Army, Marine Corps, Naval Firing Platfo rms, Navy Command and Amphibious Assault Ships, Air   Force Operations Centers and Joint Command and Control Centers. AFATDS enables the Force Commander\u2019s   guidance to be automatically applied in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan, execute, and deliver e ffects at all   levels of command within the current and future force. AFATDS can automatically tailor the selection of fire  support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters and offensive electronic   warfare asset s) based on Commander\u2019s Guidance, thereby enabling maximum effective use of all available fire  support assets across the full spectrum of conflict . It is the Government\u2019s objective to modernize the underlying AFATDS architecture, redesign the AFATDS fron t- end to a fully web and role based interface, integrate available common services made available through the Army\u2019s   Common Operating Environment (CO E) and incorporate advanced embedded training technologies to aid in   operator initiated system instruction and refresher training. This next generation version of AFATDS is referred to   as AFATDS 7. 0. 4.

        "STIGs are produc t-specific   and document applicable DoD policies and security requirements, as well as best   practices and configuration guidelines. STIGs  are associated with security   controls through Control Correlation Identifier (CCIs), which are decompositions   of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication  (SP) 80 0-53 security controls (as amplified by Committee on National Security   Systems 1253) into single, actionable, measurable items. Security Requirements   Guide (SRG) is developed by Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to HC1028 -16-R-0005   0004   Page  38 of 217     provide general security compliance guidelines and serve as source guidance  documents for STI Gs. When a STIG is not available for a product, an SRG may   be used. STIGs, SRGs and CCIs are available on the Information Assurance (IA)   Support Environment Website (https://iase. disa. mil). STIG and SRG compliance   results for products will be documented as security control assessment results   within the security assessment report and reviewed by the PM MC responsible   ISSM. The Contractor will coordinate the selection of applicable STIG, SRG,  and CCI with the Government\u2019s ISSM. The Contractor will suppor t the  implementation of security controls for the system. The Contractor will   participate in CCB and other meetings to coordinate for implementation of   security controls. Security control requirements will be documented as a trouble   report for tracking o f implementation. These will be prioritized by the CCB. The   DISA SRG/STIG Collection Tool will be used to document applicable   documents. In addition, each control will be documented with the applicable   trouble report identifier in eMASS. 6. 12. 5 Subtask 5  A ssess Security Control s    The Contractor will support Step 4 of RMF, security control assessment. The   Contractor will develop a plan to assess the security controls, known as the   Security Assessment Plan. An assessment methodology can be found in NIST   Special Publication 80 0-53A. The Contractor will assess the security controls in  accordance with the security assessment plan and DoD assessment procedures. Assessment procedures are used to verify that a security control has been properly   implemented. SRG  and STIG compliance results will be documented and used as   part of the overall security control assessment. This assessment process will be   conducted any time there are updates or changes made that would impact the assessments. Assessments will be recor ded. If no vulnerabilities are found   through the process of executing the assessment procedures, the security control is   recorded as compliant. If vulnerabilities are found, the control is recorded as Not   Compliant (NC) in the Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M), with sufficient   explanation. Vulnerability severity values are assigned to all NC controls by the   SCA as part of the security control analysis to indicate the severity associated   with the identified vulnerability. As part of the overall asses sment prior to   authority to operation, the Government will assign an assessment team. This team   will be responsible for assessing overall compliance, determination of risk level,  assessing and characterizing the aggregate level of risk to the system, and  preparing the security assessment report. The Contractor will support the ISSM   and assessment team in performing this assessment. 6. 12. 6 Subtask 6  Authorize Syste m    The Contractor will support Step 5 of RMF, authorize system. The Contractor will   assist in the authorization process through review of the POA&M with the ISSM. The POA&M identifies tasks that need to be accomplished to remediate or   mitigate vulnerabilitie s, specifies resources required to accomplish the elements  HC1028 -16-R-0005   0004   Page  39 of 217     of the plan, and includes milestones for completing tasks and their scheduled  completion dates. The Contractors\u2019 assistance in developing the POA&M is vital   to ensuring its maintenance throughout  the system life cycle. Once posted to the  POA&M, vulnerabilities will be updated after correction or mitigation actions are   completed, but not removed. The associated trouble report will be documented  and referenced in the POA&M. The Government will as semble the security   authorization package for submission to the Authorization Official (AO) for   review and final acceptance. The risk determinations will be submitted to the AO   prior to approvals. 6. 12. 7 Subtask 7  Monitor Security Control s    The Contractor wi ll support Step 6 of the RMF, continuous monitoring of security   controls. This is accomplished by continuously monitoring the system for   securit y-relevant events and configuration changes that negatively affect security   posture. The Contractor will use t he continuous monitoring strategy that was   developed for the system and documented in the SSP. Periodic assessment of the   quality of security controls implementation against performance indicators, such   as:  security incidents; Government exercises; and o perational evaluations will be   conducted by the Government, with the assistance of the Contractor. In addition, the Contractor will conduct internal assessments when system changes are being   considered, to determine the risk of the changes. The Contractor  must report any   significant change in the security posture of the system, and recommended   mitigations, immediately to the Government\u2019s ISSM. The Contractor or   Government may recommend to the SCA or AO a reassessment of any or all   security controls at an y time."

The 5% fee allocated to this incentive is based  upon the agreed upon target cost and does no t increase/decrease if the contractor realizes a target cost   underrun/overrun. The fee available for this incentive  will be set at time of awar d based upon the agreed  upon target cost and available target fee. This incentive is a  Gateway Fee incentive that b uilds off of initial and continued superior performanc e. The Government will assess performance at defined \u201cGates\u201d (as described below). If the contractor   successfully meets the performance parameters at each Gate, they earn fee. In addition, if the con tractor   sequentiall y meets the performance parameters of Gates 1, 2, and 3, they are eligible to earn a flat fee  bonus. If the contractor does not successively pass Gates 1, 2, and 3 they forfeit their opportunity to   earn the flat fee bonu s. Forfeiting t he flat fee bonus for not successively passing Gates 1, 2, and 3  does  not impact the contractor\u2019s ability to earn fee at the Final Gate. In alignment with the Statement of Objectives, paragraph, 6. 15, the contractor is to deliver engineer   releases starti ng 120 calendar days after contract award and every 60 days thereafter. It is anticipated   there will be a total of 10 engineering releases and 1 final release throughout the PoP of CLIN 0001. Therefore, the defined Gates for this incentive will focus on a subset of those engineering releases and are  as stated below:    Gate 1  - Engineering Release 3    Gate 2  - Engineering Release 6    Gate 3  - Engineering Release 9    Final Gate  - AFATDS 7. 0 Baseline Release      Gate 1 (Engineering Release 3), Gate 2 (Engineering Release 6), and Gate 3 (Engineering   Release 9)    The contractor is eligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool for engineering releases 3, 6, and 9   (for a total of 30% of the available 5% fee pool i f each gate is achieved successfully). The contractor is  eligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool at each Gate if the engineering release is delivered to the  Government with n o Priority 1 or 2 errors; no exceptions. Priority levels are as define d in the AFATDS   SRS. There is no limit on Priority 3 or 4 error rates.

Gates 1, 2, and 3 Successively Superior Flat Fee   The contractor is eligible to earn 20% of the available 5% fee pool as a flat fee bonus for successively   meeting Gates 1, 2, and 3, as defined above. Therefore, if the contractor delivers  all thre e engineering   releases (engineering releases 3, 6, and 9) with  no Priority 1 or 2 errors, they are eligible for the flat fee   bonus; no exceptions. As stated under Gates 1, 2, and 3, the priority levels are as defined in the AFATDS SRS. There is no  limit on priority 3 or 4 error rates.

Contract Titl e. Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) 7. 0 Modernizatio n    3. Introductio n. This Incentives Plan contains the processes, procedures, and incentive criteria that will   be utilized to evaluate the contractor\u2019s performance throughout the course of the AFATDS 7. 0 contract. This plan will be utilized for completing and determining i ncentive fee for all cost plus incentive fee   Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs). The methodology behind Incentive Plan will be on a bilateral   basis; however the Government will unilaterally make determinations on earned incentive fee based upon   the contrac tor\u2019s performance in alignment to the criteria outlined in this plan. Government fee   determinations are not subject to contractor disputes. 4. Concep t:  The purpose of this Incentives Plan is to incentivize superior performance and motivate the  contra ctor to successfully complete the overall objectives of this AFATDS 7. 0 program while controlling   cost, schedule, and risk. This Incentives Plan is built upon a performance based incentives methodology   and is uniquely structured to align incentives with m easurable performance based outcomes. HC1028 -16-R-0005   0004   Page  85 of 217       5. Incentives Revisions/Optimization :  As stated above, the methodology behind this Incentives Plan is   performance based incentives/di s-incentives. Therefore, this plan will be updated as needed throughout   the cont ract Period of Performance (PoP) in order to ensure it continues to effectively incentivize superior   performance and result in a sound business arrangement between all parties. Any changes to this plan   after contract award will be mutually agreed upon be tween the Government and contractor. 6. Incentive Fee Allocatio n. This Incentives Plan is currently structured to incentivize contractor   performance under the AFATDS Modernization and Development Baseline (CLIN 0001). The incentives   for AFATDS  Modernization and Development Target (CLIN 0002 ), will be subject to mutual agreement   prior to exercising that option with the exceptio n of the Cost Control Incentive. At time of award, the contractor\u2019s target cost and target fee will be agreed upon for  CLIN 0001, the   contractor will be eligible to earn up to 15% fee/bonus pool on the target cost of CLIN 0001. With the   exception of the provision fee listed in paragraph 7. 1 for Incentive #1, the Government will perform an  incentive review prior to paymen t of any fees. In incentive #2, the Government will review and make a  final determination for the fee earned in performance of engineering releases and provide the results to the   contracting officer. The contractor will then be notified of the approval t o invoice against the incentive   CLIN . 7. Incentives . This contract will utilize a multiple incentive approach. Below are the incentives the   contractor is eligible to earn during the PoP of CLIN 0001. All percentages will be rounded to the nearest   tenth. 7. 1 Incentive #1:  Cost Control ( 0-5% Incentive)   The Government will assess contractor cost control. At time of award, a target cost for CLIN 0001, based   upon the contractor\u2019s proposal, will be finalized and documented in Section B of the contract. T he  following calculation(s) will be utilized to determine fee on cost control performance as related to the   target cost of CLIN 0001. Target Cost     The contractor will be eligible for 2% fee for meeting target cost. Below is the formula to be  utilized :      *The above table is an example to show calculation/formula, amounts are subject to the agreed upon  target cost.

HC1028 -16-R-0005   0004   Page  68 of 217     b. Past performance information is relevant information regarding the contractor\u2019s actions   under previously awarded contracts. The written performance evaluation will state   whether the service s/supplies met the Government\u2019s stated requirements and   specifications and if they were performed/delivered on time. It includes, for example, the   contractor\u2019s record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good  workmanship; the contra ctor\u2019s adherence to contract schedules, including the   administrative aspects of performance; the contractor\u2019s history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the   contractor\u2019s busines s-like concern for t he interest of the customer. This evaluation may   be either printed or electronic format, as defined by the Government . c. The evaluation of the contractor\u2019s performance will be used as a criterion for   exercising any unexercised option. The evaluation will  also be used by DISA and  other Government agencies as source selection information to support future   Government procurements . H. 5 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI)/OCI MITIGATION PLA N    a. An organizational conflict of interest means that because of othe r activities or   relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render   impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a perso n has an   unfair competitive advantage. The Government seeks to acquire unbiased advi ce  and/or goods and services from offerors/contractors that are free from, or have   mitigated, Organizational Conflicts of Interest , as defined in FAR 2. 101, relating to this contract . b. In order for the Government to try to prevent an OCI relating to this contract, the   parties  to this contract agree that the contractor\u2019s future contracting with the   Government may be restricted as outlined in FAR Subpart 9. 5, if the   offeror/ contractor and DISA are unable to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate actual or   potential OCI before contract award . c. DISA will not automatically exclude a vendor from a competitive acquisition due to   an actual or potential OCI. The Contracting Office is comm itted to working with   potential vendors to eliminate or mitigate actual and potential OCI situations, without detriment to the integrity of the competitive process, the DISA mission, or the   legitimate business interests of the vendor community . d. If the off eror or contractor is aware, or should have been aware, of an OCI before   award of this contract or any task under against the contract, and does not fully   disclose that conflict to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the   contractor for de fault. HC1028 -16-R-0005   0004   Page  69 of 217     e. The offeror or contractor, by submitting an offer and/or signing the contract, warrants   that it is  not now aware of any actual or potential OCI relating to this contract . f. After contract award, the contractor shall have an ongoing obligation to make  \u201ca  prompt and full disclosure\u201d to the Contracting Officer of any OCI that arises during   the performance of the contract, as well as newly discovered conflicts that existed   before contract award . g. The OCI Mitigation Plan shall become part of the resultant contract and the   contractor shall update its OCI Mitigation Plan within 30 days of any changes to the   legal construct of the organization, subcontractor changes, or significant management   or ownership changes that would result in an actual or potential OC I under this   contract . H. 6 52. 237- 9001 Enterpris e-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application   (eCMRA) Reporting. ENTERPRIS E-WIDE CONTRACTOR MANPOWER REPORTING APPLICATION (eCMRA)   REPORTING (JAN 2015 )   The contractor shall ensure ALL contractor labor hours including subcontractor, at all   levels/tiers, labor hours required for the performance of services provided under this contract are   reported via a secure data collection site. The contractor and all  subcontractors, at all levels/tiers, providing direct labor under this contract   shall report complete and accurate data for the labor executed during the period of performance during each Government fiscal year (FY), which runs from October 1 to September  30. The   Contractor shall input the data into the appropriate eCMRA reporting tool, which can be   accessed via a secure web site at http://www. ecmra. mil/. There are four separate eCMRA tools:   Army, Air Force, Navy and All Other Defense Components. The approp riate eCMRA reporting   tool to use is determined by the requiring activity being supported (e. g. , if DISA awards a   contract for an Air Force requiring activity, the contractor shall load the required reporting data in the \u201cDepartment of Air Force CMRA\u201d too l). While inputs may be reported any time during   the FY, all data shall be reported no later than October 31 of each calendar year. The contractor   shall completely fill in all required data fields. The contractor shall enter initial data into the   appropria te eCMRA tool to establish the basic contract record no later than 15 working days   after receipt of contract award or contract modification incorporating this clause. The contractor   shall notify the COR when the basic contract record has been established i n the appropriate   eCMRA tool . eCMRA User Manuals and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) are available at   http://www. ecmra. mil/     Contractors may direct technical questions to the eCMRA help desk at  usaf. pentagon. sa f- aq. mbx."

As the DoD transitions from host based security compliance assessments   to the utilization of enterprise tools, organizational processes and  workflows will be required to adapt a new methodology in support of   continuous monitoring efforts. Industry standards such as the Security   Content Automa tion Protocols (SCAP) and ACAS are evolving in support   of the mission to rapidly deploy content to any security compliance tool in a normalized format. The compliance tool is now becoming a weapon on the information security battlefield. The Contractor w ill develop a process   for implementation of cybersecurity tools developed by DoD for   monitoring compliance and assessing systems for vulnerability introduced in the development, implementation or maintenance phases of a system. This suite of tools will be  deployed as the Continuous Monitoring Suite   (CMS). The Contractor will deliver the CMS for use across PM MC   Systems . CDRL A03 1   b. ACAS is an integrated software solution that is scalable to an unlimited   number of locations. The solution\u2019s tiering ability  will give DoD   enhanced enterprise security while being easy to install and manage. It   can be easily deployed via download to all DoD agencies  \u2013 without the   need to procure and install appliance devices. The ACAS product suite   easily provides the require d automated network vulnerability scanning,  configuration assessment, application vulnerability scanning, device   configuration assessment, and network discovery it needs. Further, the   product suite generates the required reports and data, with a centraliz ed  console, and is SCAP compliant. The Contractor will include the ACAS   software in the CMS. c. SCAP provides information awareness based on standardized results from   those tools to accreditors; systems administrators; information system security managers;  and senior civilian and military commanders for   determining risk to their environment. The SCAP Validation Program is   designed to test the ability of products to use the features and functionality   available through SCAP and its component standards. SCAP  checklists   standardize and enable automation of the linkage between computer   security configurations and the  NIST  SP 80 0-53 controls framework. The   current version of SCAP is meant to perform initial measurement and   continuous monitoring of security sett ings and corresponding SP 800 -53  controls. In this way, SCAP contributes to the implementation,  assessment, and monitoring steps of the DoD RMF.

The Contractor will provide a system safety program   plan for Government review and approval. The SSPP will include the tasks the   Contractor w ill perform to fulfill the level of rigor activities and system and software   safety analysis per MI L-STD-882E and the Joint  Software System Safety Engineering   handbook. The Contractor will provide a safety assessment report for Government   review and appr oval. The safety assessment report will include the outputs from the   tasks specified in the SSPP. The Contractor will analyze the AFATDS operational and   requirement s, considering the new AFATDS client architecture and AFATDS operating   in CPCE and MCE. The Contractor will provide a preliminary hazard list, related to the   design, operations, and functional capabilities of the proposed design, operating in CPCE   and MCE, and recommend a strategy for mitigating, controlling, or minimizing the   potential hazards. The Contractor will analyze and provide the safety impact of code   reuse.

This program will allow the maximum insight for   the Government of  all test activities and for detailed descriptions and tracking of   all testing errors. The Contractor will develop and deliver test plans, test  descriptions, and test reports. CDRL  A034, A035, A036     b The Contractor will design and execute regression testi ng to verify that prior   existing capability still function as required. The Contractor will conduct an  analysis of the new requirements, anticipated interfaces, and other interoperability   aspects to determine test modifications and scope of regression tes t threads to be   executed during a specific release of the software and  develop the regression test   threads to ensure that no collateral breakage has occurred during the development   and that no new errors have been introduced into software components that   previously executed correctly. The Contractor will execute the regression test   during the testing of each build of an AFATDS version. c Integration of the latest NABK with AFATDS 7. 0 will be performed. The   Contractor will establish a suite of test cases sp ecific to exercising the NABK   within AFATDS 7. 0 and conduct NABK specific testing in sufficient depth to accommodate safety considerations. NABK test cases used on the prior AFATDS   versions will be provided as GFI to the Contractor . d The Contractor will modify the NABK test tool that auto -runs the NABK test   cases provided as GFI. The NABK test cases will be provided in XML format, which necessitates a change to the front end of the NABK test tool. HC1028 -16-R-0005   0004   Page  44 of 217       e The Contractor will conduct a Tes t for Record (TFR), which is defined as the   controlled execution of Government approved syste m-level test cases, regression   threads, and a stability test. The Contractor will ensure that the TFR also includes   testing of security and safety requirements. T he TFR is subject to Government   observation, the focus of which is to determine the level of compliance with the   AFATDS specifications .",

Normally, price reasonableness is established through cost and   price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15. 404. The Government will determine   completeness of the offeror's proposal by verifying that all solicitation requirements have been   priced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs are presented in a clear and useful format. The  Government will evaluate offerors' proposed costs for reasonableness, completeness, affordability and realism. 6. 1 General Instructions      6. 1. 1 Cost  Reasonableness, Realism, and Completeness    This section is to assist you in submitting cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the   reasonableness, completeness, realism, balance, and/or affordability of your proposed cost. The   Government will v erify that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly   calculated, and prices are presented in a clear and useful format. Note that unrealistically low or   high proposed costs, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for elimina ting a proposal from   competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has   submitted an unrealistic proposal. Additionally, unbalanced costs pose an unacceptable risk to  the Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror\u2019s proposal. Cost submissions should be   sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness and be adequate enough to support and sustain a DCAA audit. 6. 1. 2 Cost/Price Information   Information beyond that required by this instruction shall  not be submitted, unless you consider   it essential to document or support your cost/price position. All information relating to the   proposed price, including all required supporting documentation must be included in the section  of the proposal designated as the Cost/Price Volume. Under no circumstances shall this   information and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal . Labor and overhead rates should include sufficient detail to sustain a DCAA audit (e. g. , direct   labor rates, overhead, fring e benefits, General and Administrative Expense (G&A), fee, etc. ). The offeror must provide the basis of estimate for all rates with detailed rationale to support the   rates. For indirect rates, the preferred method for providing support detail is throug h the  submission of a Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) or Forward Pricing Rate   Recommendation (FPRR). However, in the absence of a FPRA/FPRR, the Government will   accept all rates and factors by year utilized in the development of the Forward Pricing R ate  Proposal and the basis for these rates and factors (e. g. , breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data). If the contractor is not required to maintain forward pricing rates then the Government will   accept other methods of validation. These methods include  approved provisional billing rates,  other submitted/approved rates, or the submission of proposed rate calculations (including the   pools & bases) and the basis of all calculations (e. g.",
        ", breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data). The offeror shall state if  rates have been provided to the cognizant Administrative Contracting  HC1028 -16-R-0005   0004   Page  184 of 217     Officer /DCAA office for review or negotiation; if rates have not been submitted, explanation is   required. If a subcontractor relationship exists, subcontract costs must also be deline ated in accordance  with the requirements above. If needed, the subcontract may submit its unsanitized cost breakout   directly to the Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer. The subcontractor shall also provide   contact information for its cognizant DCAA o ffice. 6. 1. 3 Cost or Pricing Information Requirement s    In accordance with  FAR 15. 403 -1(b) and 15. 403 -3(a), data other than certified cost or pricing   data may be required to support cos t reasonableness. Information shall be provided in  accordance with  FAR 15. 403 -5. If, after r eceipt of proposals, the contracting officer determines   the required conditions of adequate competition do not exist that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in  FAR 15. 403 -1 apply,  the offeror may be required to certify its submitted cost or pricing data . 6. 2 Volume Organization     The Cost/Price volume shall consist of the following sections :    Part A -Introductio n   Table of Contents; summary descriptions of estimating, purchasing, and accounting systems;   changes to estimating, accounting practices, or Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) d isclosure   statement . Part B -Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet s   Cost or pricing information and supporting data, to include estimating methodology . Part C - Other informatio n  Such as GFE, DCAA information, long lead costs, termination costs, development/production  schedule, inflation rate summary and explanation, life cycle cost, and special tooling/test   equipment. List each exception to the ground rules and assumptions provided in the solicitation and each qualification of the Cost/Price vol ume, if any. Provide complete rationale for any   exceptions . 6. 3 Part A -Introductio n     6. 3. 1 Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms. If necessary, provide a glossary of abbreviations and acronyms used with an explanation for   each. Glossaries do not  count against the page limitations for their respective volumes . 6. 3. 2 Estimating Syste m  Provide a summary description of your standard estimating system or methods. The summary   description shall cover separately each major cost element (e. g. , direct mat erial, engineering   labor, manufacturing labor, indirect costs, ODC, overhead, G&A, etc. ). Also, identify any  HC1028 -16-R-0005   0004   Page  185 of 217     deviations from your standard estimating procedures in preparing this proposal volume. Indicate   whether you have Government approval of your syst em and if so, provide evidence of such  approval . 6. 3. 3 Purchasing Syste m  Provide a summary description of your purchasing system or methods (e. g. , how material   requirements are determined, how sources are selected, when firm quotes are obtained, what   provi sion is made to ensure quantity and other discounts). Also, identify any deviations from   your standard procedures in preparing this proposal. Indicate whether you have Government   approval of your system and if so, provide evidence of such approval . 6. 3. 4 Accounting Syste m  Indicate whether the DCAA has determined your accounting system to be adequate and if so,  provide evidence of such determination. Also, identify any deviations from your standard  procedures in preparing this proposal . 6. 3. 5 Explanati on of Estimating Methods Used    Explain the methodology  used to estimate each cost element.

The security plan should inc lude implementation status, responsible entities, resources, and  estimated completion dates. Security plans may also include, but are not limited   to, a compiled list of system characteristics or qualities required for system registration, key securit y-related documents such as a risk assessment, privacy   impact assessment, system interconnection agreements, contingency plan, security   configurations, configuration management plan, and incident response plan. 6. 12. 2 Subtask 2  Categorize Syste m  The Contractor wil l support Step 1 of the RMF, categorize the system. The   system has the following RMF Categorization levels:  Confidentiality:  Medium; Integrity:  High; Availability:  High. The results of the system categorization will be documented in the SSP. The sys tem categorization is a coordinated effort   between the Contractor and the Government\u2019s cybersecurity team. The system   will be described (including system boundary) and documented in the SSP. The   Government has the responsibility of registering the syste m in the enterprise   Mission Assurance Support Service (eMASS). After the Government registers  HC1028 -16-R-0005   0004   Page  37 of 217     the system in eMASS the Contractor will be responsible for inputting data into the   eMASS system, as outlined in the following sections . 6. 12. 3 Subtask 3  Select Securi ty Control s    The Contractor will support Step 2 of the RMF to select appropriate security   controls based on the system categorization. The Contractor will assist the   Government in the selection of appropriate controls by identification of the   security con trol baseline for the system, and documenting these in the SSP. Baseline controls and control overlays will be tailored for the system. Overlays   may add or subtract security controls, or provide additional guidance regarding   security controls, resulting i n a set of security controls applicable to the system   that is a combination of the baseline and overlay. The combination of baselines   and overlays address the unique security protection needs associated with the   system. If necessary, control sets will b e tailored (modified) in response to   increased risk from changes in threats or vulnerabilities, or variations in risk   tolerance. Tailoring decisions must be coordinated with the Government, and  aligned with operational considerations and the system environ ment. Security   controls will be added or removed only as a function of specified, ris k-based   determinations. Tailoring decisions, including the specific rationale (e. g. , mapping to risk tolerance) for those decisions, will be documented in the security   plan for the system. A monitoring strategy must be developed and documented as   a syste m-level strategy for the continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of   security controls employed within or inherited by the system, and monitoring of   any proposed or ac tual changes to the system and its environment of operation. The strategy must include the plan for annual assessments of a subset of   implemented security controls, and the level of independence required of the   assessor (e. g. , Information System Security M anager (ISSM) or Security Control   Assessor (SCA)). The breadth, depth, and rigor of these annual assessments will   be reflective of the security categorization of the system and threats to the system. Delivery of the security control selection will consis t of input into the eMASS   system on SIPRNET . 6. 12. 4 Subtask 4  Implement Security Control s    The Contractor will support Step 3 of RMF, implementation of security controls. The system (including applications) will be configured in accordance with  applicable Secu rity Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) which are  coordinated with the Government ISSM and SCA."

The information submitted sh all  reference only the offeror\u2019s, significant teaming partner\u2019s, or significant subcontractor\u2019s past   performance on the submitted effort, rather than the past performance of other contractors on the   submitted effort. b. In addition, the prime offeror s hall include information on a minimum of one recent contract   performed by the prime offeror that you consider most relevant in demonstrating your ability to  perform the proposed effort. Please see the maximum limitations set forth in subparagraph d  below . c. Recent contracts are considered to be efforts that the prime offeror and its teaming partners,   joint venture or significant subcontractors have performed within the past five years prior to original  issuance of the solicitation, or for ongoing efforts  the period of performance of which must   have started at least nine months before the original proposal due date . d. The total of Past and Present Performance Information references will not exceed three pages   per reference. Total page count for this Pa st Performance volume is annotated above in Table 2 -2.

The past performance evaluation team will consider the performance  quality of relevant recent efforts for the second aspect of the past performance evaluatio n using   Section M Table 4, Past Performance Quality Assessment. Finally, the past performance  evaluation team will review this past performance information and determine the quality as it applies to performance confidence assessment. Performance Confiden ce Assessment ratings are  identified in Section M, Table 5. 5. 3. 1 Specific Content    Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the submitted past performance efforts are deemed   relevant to the proposed effort and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate. This may   include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior   contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk. Merely having problems does   not automatically equate  to a limited or no confidence rating because the problems encountered may   have been on a more complex program, or an offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the   ability to overcome the problems encountered. The offeror is required to clearly demonstra te  management actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions in terms of   improvements achieved or problems rectified. Categorize the relevant information into the specific   technical/management subfactors used to evaluate the prop osal. 5. 3. 2 Organizational Structure Change History    Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or   between conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection. As a result, it is sometimes   difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this procurement. To f acilitate this   relevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a \"roadmap\" describing all such changes in the organization of your company.",

The AFATDS is a multi -service, automated Command, Coordination,  Communication, and Computing system that provides automated fire support and coordination to a ll echelons, from Firing Unit through Theater Level, at Army, Marine   Corps, Naval Firing Platforms, Navy Command and Amphibious Assault Ships, Air Force   Operations Centers and Joint Command and Control Centers. AFATDS enables the Force   Commander\u2019s guidanc e to be automatically applied in the Fires Warfighting Function to   plan, execute, and deliver effects at all levels of command within the current and future force. AFATDS can automatically tailor the selection of fire support assets (field artillery, morta rs,  close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters and offensive electronic warfare assets)   based on Commander\u2019s Guidance, thereby enabling maximum effective use of all available fire support assets across the full spectrum of conflict. It is the G overnment\u2019s objective to modernize the underlying AFATDS architecture, redesign  the AFATDS fron t-end to a fully web and role based interface, integrate available common  services made available through the Army\u2019s Common Operating Environment (COE) and incorporate advanced embedded training technologies to aid in operator initiated system   instruction and refresher training.

Basis for Contract Awar d    This is a best value trad e-off source selection conducted in accordance with FAR 15. 3, Source   Selection, as supplemented by the DFARS and the DARS. These regulations are available  electronically at  http://www. ditco. disa. mil/hq/aqinfo. as p and http://farsite. hill. af. mil . The   Government will select the best overall offeror, based on integrated assessment of the ev aluation   factors and subfactors described belo w. Contracts may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed   responsible in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the   solicitation\u2019s requirements (to include all stated terms, condit ions, representations, certifications,  and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation) and is judged, based on the   evaluation factors and subfactors to represent the best value to the Government. The   Government seeks to award to the  offeror who gives DISA the greatest confidence that it will   best meet, or exceed, the requirements. b. Evaluatio n      The technical proposal should include all information the offeror wants the Government to  consider and evaluate regarding its compan y\u2019s ability to perform all required tasks and conform   to all required terms and conditions. The best value determination will be based on the stated  evaluation factors. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussion s with   offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions or seek  clarifications if the contracting officer determines they are necessary. In the event issues   pertaining to a proposed contract cannot be resolved to the contracti ng officer\u2019s satisfaction, the  Government reserves the right to withdraw and cancel the  solicitation. In such event, offerors   will be notified in writing. In the event a competitive range is established and the contracting   officer determines that the nu mber of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range   exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the contracting officer   may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will  permit an efficient competition . c. Evaluation of Option s      The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options   to the total price for the base period. The offeror shall submit pricing for the base period and a ll  option periods, including option pricing for an additional si x-month extension period that may be  HC1028 -16-R-0005   0004   Page  207 of 217     authorized in accordance with (IAW) FAR 52. 217 -8. See FAR 52. 217 -8 which authorizes the   Government to require continued performance of any services withi n the limits and at the rates   specified in the contract. The pricing proposal should include a separate line item for the   additional si x-month extension period IAW FAR 52. 217 -8. The pricing for the additional si x- month extension period, IAW FAR 52. 217 -8, applies to the Engineering Support Services and  ODC CLINs only. These prices shall be identical to the proposed pricing in the six months prior   to expiration of the base period, or the final option period, if option periods are present. The   total evaluate d price will consist of the contractor\u2019s proposed price for the base period, all option  periods, and the option pricing for the additional si x-month extension period. The Government   may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are sign ificantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options. d.",

The successful offeror will be required to  provide reports on small business subcontractor participation in accordance with FAR 52. 219 -25  in Section I of th e contract . If the offeror is other than a small business, the offeror's Small Business Subcontracting Plan submitted IAW  FAR 52. 219 -9 and Section L paragraph 7. 2. 4. 2 shall  also be evaluated to   determine the extent to which the offeror identifies and commits to the participation of small  businesses, whether as joint venture members, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor. Failure to  submit such a plan will render the offeror  ineligible for award. The Government will evaluate   the small business participation and subcontracting plans to determine whether it is acceptable or   unacceptable, using the rating and descriptions outlined in Table 6.

The offeror's proposed estimated costs shall  not be  controlling for source selection purposes. PC shall be measured as follows:     - Government estimate of anticipated performance costs and proposed fee . - Government estimate of anticipated performance costs plus any fee to be earned  under the cost incentive . - Government estimate of anticipated performance costs plus any base fee proposed  plus any fee anticipated to be awarded. (See FAR 15. 404 -1(d))       (2) Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such  options. (3) The offeror\u2019s cost proposal will be evaluated, using one or more of the   techniques defined in FAR 15. 404, in order to determine if it is reasonable, realisti c, and  complete. For additional information see FAR 31. 201 -3. (4) The Government will evaluate the realism of each offeror\u2019s proposed costs. This will include an evaluation of the extent to which proposed costs are sufficient for the work  to be perfor med, reflective of a clear understanding of the requirements, and consistent with the   unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror\u2019s technical/management   proposal (FAR 15. 404- 1(d)(1) and 2. 101). (5)  In accordance with FAR 15. 304(e), all evaluation factors other than  cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

HC1028 -16-R-0005   0004   Page  68 of 217     b. Past performance information is relevant information regarding the contractor\u2019s actions   under previously awarded contracts. The written performance evaluation will state   whether the service s/supplies met the Government\u2019s stated requirements and   specifications and if they were performed/delivered on time. It includes, for example, the   contractor\u2019s record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good  workmanship; the contra ctor\u2019s adherence to contract schedules, including the   administrative aspects of performance; the contractor\u2019s history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the   contractor\u2019s busines s-like concern for t he interest of the customer. This evaluation may   be either printed or electronic format, as defined by the Government . c. The evaluation of the contractor\u2019s performance will be used as a criterion for   exercising any unexercised option. The evaluation will  also be used by DISA and  other Government agencies as source selection information to support future   Government procurements . H. 5 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI)/OCI MITIGATION PLA N    a. An organizational conflict of interest means that because of othe r activities or   relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render   impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a perso n has an   unfair competitive advantage. The Government seeks to acquire unbiased advi ce  and/or goods and services from offerors/contractors that are free from, or have   mitigated, Organizational Conflicts of Interest , as defined in FAR 2. 101, relating to this contract . b. In order for the Government to try to prevent an OCI relating to this contract, the   parties  to this contract agree that the contractor\u2019s future contracting with the   Government may be restricted as outlined in FAR Subpart 9. 5, if the   offeror/ contractor and DISA are unable to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate actual or   potential OCI before contract award . c. DISA will not automatically exclude a vendor from a competitive acquisition due to   an actual or potential OCI. The Contracting Office is comm itted to working with   potential vendors to eliminate or mitigate actual and potential OCI situations, without detriment to the integrity of the competitive process, the DISA mission, or the   legitimate business interests of the vendor community . d. If the off eror or contractor is aware, or should have been aware, of an OCI before   award of this contract or any task under against the contract, and does not fully   disclose that conflict to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the   contractor for de fault. HC1028 -16-R-0005   0004   Page  69 of 217     e. The offeror or contractor, by submitting an offer and/or signing the contract, warrants   that it is  not now aware of any actual or potential OCI relating to this contract . f. After contract award, the contractor shall have an ongoing obligation to make  \u201ca  prompt and full disclosure\u201d to the Contracting Officer of any OCI that arises during   the performance of the contract, as well as newly discovered conflicts that existed   before contract award . g. The OCI Mitigation Plan shall become part of the resultant contract and the   contractor shall update its OCI Mitigation Plan within 30 days of any changes to the   legal construct of the organization, subcontractor changes, or significant management   or ownership changes that would result in an actual or potential OC I under this   contract .

The past performance information forms and information obtained from other   sources will be  used to establish the degree of relevancy of past performance. The Government   will use the following degrees of relevancy when assessing recent, relevant contracts   (Department of Defense (DoD) Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3. 1. 3. 1) . Table 3.

(3) Performance Quality Assessment (How well the contractor performed on the   contract. )    The Government will consider the performance quality of recent and relevant efforts. For each  recent and relevant past performance reference reviewed, the performance quality of the work   performed will be assessed. The quality assessment consists of an i n-depth evaluation of the past   performance questionnaire responses, PPIRS information, interviews with Government   customers, and if applicable, commercial clients. It may include interviews with Defense   Contract Management Agency officials or other sourc es known to the Government.

As a result of the relevancy   and quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an integrated   performance confidence assessment rating. The resulting performance confidence as sessment   rating is made at the past performance factor level and represents an overall evaluation of   contractor performance. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom   information on past performance is not available will not be e valuated favorably or unfavorably   on past performance and, as a result, will receive an \"Unknown Confidence\" rating for the past   performance factor. The past performance factor will receive one of the performance confidence assessments   described in the D oD Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3. 1. 3. 3.

Below is the formula to be utilized:          *The above table is an example to show calculation/formula, amounts are subject to the agreed upon  target cost. The contractor is eligible for provisional fee payments up to 1% of the agreed upon target cost,   throughout the course of CLIN 0001 PoP as long as their Estimate at Complete (EAC), reported in  Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) A001  \u2013 Integrated Progr am Management Report (IPMR)   remains under or equal to the agreed upon target cost. If the contractor submits CDRL A001 submission   that shows EAC has exceeded the agreed upon target cost all provisional fee payments will be suspended   for the remainder of t he PoP. Provisional fee payments will not commence until after the Government   has approved the Integrated Baseline Review (IBR). Once the contractor has held a successful IBR, they   will be able to invoice fee in each voucher.

The contractor will then invoice   this set amount o f fee in each invoice as long as their EAC remains under or equal to the agreed upon  target cost. 7. 2 Incentive #2:  Performance ( 0-5% Gateway Incentive )  The contractor is eligible to earn up to 5% fee for delivering an AFATDS 7. 0 baseline that opera tionally   demonstrates it meets all baseline requirements as outlined in the AFATDS Software Requirements  Specification (SRS) by the end of the CLIN 0001 PoP. The 5% fee allocated to this incentive is based  upon the agreed upon target cost and does no t increase/decrease if the contractor realizes a target cost   underrun/overrun. The fee available for this incentive  will be set at time of awar d based upon the agreed  upon target cost and available target fee. This incentive is a  Gateway Fee incentive that b uilds off of initial and continued superior performanc e. The Government will assess performance at defined \u201cGates\u201d (as described below). If the contractor   successfully meets the performance parameters at each Gate, they earn fee. In addition, if the con tractor   sequentiall y meets the performance parameters of Gates 1, 2, and 3, they are eligible to earn a flat fee  bonus. If the contractor does not successively pass Gates 1, 2, and 3 they forfeit their opportunity to   earn the flat fee bonu s. Forfeiting t he flat fee bonus for not successively passing Gates 1, 2, and 3  does  not impact the contractor\u2019s ability to earn fee at the Final Gate. In alignment with the Statement of Objectives, paragraph, 6. 15, the contractor is to deliver engineer   releases starti ng 120 calendar days after contract award and every 60 days thereafter. It is anticipated   there will be a total of 10 engineering releases and 1 final release throughout the PoP of CLIN 0001. Therefore, the defined Gates for this incentive will focus on a subset of those engineering releases and are  as stated below:    Gate 1  - Engineering Release 3    Gate 2  - Engineering Release 6    Gate 3  - Engineering Release 9    Final Gate  - AFATDS 7. 0 Baseline Release      Gate 1 (Engineering Release 3), Gate 2 (Engineering Release 6), and Gate 3 (Engineering   Release 9)    The contractor is eligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool for engineering releases 3, 6, and 9   (for a total of 30% of the available 5% fee pool i f each gate is achieved successfully). The contractor is  eligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool at each Gate if the engineering release is delivered to the  Government with n o Priority 1 or 2 errors; no exceptions. Priority levels are as define d in the AFATDS   SRS. There is no limit on Priority 3 or 4 error rates. The data used to substantiate this performance   assessment will be the contractor\u2019s testing data supplied in the applicable CDRL  A035 \u2013 Software Test   Description. Gates 1, 2, and 3 Successively Superior Flat Fee   The contractor is eligible to earn 20% of the available 5% fee pool as a flat fee bonus for successively   meeting Gates 1, 2, and 3, as defined above. Therefore, if the contractor delivers  all thre e engineering   releases (engineering releases 3, 6, and 9) with  no Priority 1 or 2 errors, they are eligible for the flat fee   bonus; no exceptions. As stated under Gates 1, 2, and 3, the priority levels are as defined in the AFATDS SRS. There is no  limit on priority 3 or 4 error rates. The data used to substantiate this performance assessment will be the  contractor\u2019s testing data supplied in the applicable CDRL  A035 \u2013 Software Test Description.",
