Include in its contracts with any and all subcontractors the requirements of a, b, and, c \nabove.  \n \n13.   Liability Coverage  \n \n Unless otherwise expressly excepted in the procurement announcement documents prepared by the \nCounty, the Contractor shall take out and maintain during the life of the Contract such bodily injury, liability \nand property damage liability insurance as shall protect it and the County from claims for damages for \npersonal injury, including death, as  well as from claims for property damage, which may arise from its \nactivities under this agreement.  Such insurance shall at least have the coverages and be in the amounts set \nforth in section 15 \"Insurance and Bond Requirements \" set forth below and shall name the Board of \nSupervisors and the County as  Additional Insureds.  Such insurance must be issued by a company admitted \nwithin the Commonwealth of Virginia and with at least a Best 's Key Rating of A:V1.  The Contractor shall \nprovide the County with a ce rtificate of insurance showing such insurance to be in force and providing that \nthe insurer shall give the County at least 30 days ' notice prior to cancellation or other termination of such \ninsurance.  \n \n14.   Loss or Damage in Transit  \n \n Delivery by a contractor t o a common carrier does not constitute delivery to state agencies or \npolitical subdivisions.  Any claim for loss or damage incurred during delivery shall be between the contractor \nand the carrier.  The state accepts title only when goods are received regar dless of the F.O.B. point.  The \nreceiving agency will note all apparent damages in transit on the freight bill and notify the contractor.  \nDiscovery of concealed damages or loss will be reported by the receiving agency to the carrier and the \ncontractor wit hin seven days of receipt and prior to removal from the point of delivery if possible.  The \ncontractor shall make immediate replacement of the damaged or lost merchandise or be in default of the \ncontract.  It shall be the contractor 's responsibility to file a claim against the carrier.  If damage is to a small \nquantity, with the approval of the agency, the contractor may deduct the amount of damage or loss from his \nor her invoice to the agency in lieu of replacement.  \n \n15.   Freight  \n \n By signing an I .F.B. the bidd er certifies that the bid price(s) offered for F.O.B. destination include \nonly the actual freight charges at the lowest and best rate and is based upon the actual weight of the goods to \nbe shipped.  Freight charges are, therefore, established for each indi vidual purchase.  If a requirement is bid \nF.O.B. origin, the contractor shall prepay the charges and add the amount to the invoice.  A copy of the \nfreight bill should be attached to all invoices that include freight charges.  In a solicitation specifying F .O.B. \norigin the state will consider freight cost in the evaluation of bids.  \n \n16.   Termination for Default    \n \nIn case of default by a contractor for failure to deliver or perform in accordance with the contract \nspecifications or terms and conditions, the County  may procure the articles or services from other sources and \nhold the defaulting contractor responsible for any resulting additional purchase and administrative costs.  The \nCounty will normally repurchase from the next low bidder or purchase competitively by resolicitation.  If the \nrepurchase results in increased costs to the County, a letter will be sent to the defaulted contractor required \npayment for additional costs.  When repayment is requested, the contractor will be removed from future \nbidding until the repayment has occurred.  Contractors shall not be liable for any excess cost if the failure to \nperform arises out of any act of war, order of legal authority, strikes, act of God, or other unavoidable causes ",

The County reserves the right to require insurance of any Contractor in greater amounts \nprovided not ice of such requirements is stated in the Solicitation.  \n \n18.   Assignment of Contract  \n \n The contract shall not be assignable by the Contractor in whole or in part without the written \nconsent of the County.  \n \n19.   Execution  \n \n All work performed shall be in accordance w ith all local, state and federal codes, laws and \nregulations, including but not limited to: Virginia Conflict of Interest Act, Virginia Fair Employment \nContracting Act, Virginia Freedom of Information Act, Virginia Prompt Payment Act, and the Virginia \nPublic Procurement Act.  \n \n20.   No Waiver  \n \n Any failure of the County to demand rigid adherence to one or more of this Agreement 's \nprovisions in the contract, on one or more occasions, shall not be construed as a waiver nor deprive the \nCounty of the right to insist upon strict compliance with the terms of this Contract.  Any waiver of a term \nof this Contract, in whole or in part, must be in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver to be \neffective.  \n \n \n21.   Termination and Cancellation  \n \n The County shall have the u nilateral right to terminate this contract for default, in the event that \nany one or more of the following events of default occur or continue during the term of this agreement:  (a) \nthe Contractor shall fail to deliver the equipment or services required b y this contract or, (b) the Contractor \nshall repeatedly fail to respond to request for maintenance or other services within the time limits set forth \nin the contract or, (c) the Contractor shall breach any of the other cures after receiving a \" Show Cause \nNotice \" identifying the failure, then providing the Contractor ten (10) days to cure the \nfailure/nonperformance.  \n \n If the Contractor fails to answer the cure notice, or does not correct the deficiencies noted, the \nCounty may immediately terminate the agreem ent for default.  In such event the County will only be liable \nfor cost incurred to the date of termination.  All costs of de -installation and return of the equipment will be \nat the Contractor 's expense.  The County 's failure to exercise its right to termi nate for default under this \nprovision shall not be construed as a waiver of its right to terminate, rescind or revoke this contract in the \nevent of any subsequent breach of any provisions of this agreement.  \n \n The County has the right to terminate the agree ment in whole or in part of convenience and shall \nrequire no breach of contract by the offeror as a condition of termination.  This right of termination for \nconvenience may be exercised at the sole unconditional discretion of the County.  If the contract i s \nterminated in whole or in part for the convenience of the County, the Contractor shall be paid for the \nservice done and the remaining buyout of the lease to the date of termination, but shall not be paid any \nother fees or lost profits.  \n \n22.

Include in its contracts with any and all subcontractors the requirements of a, b, and, c \nabove.  \n \n13.   Liability Coverage  \n \n Unless otherwise expressly excepted in the procurement announcement documents prepared by the \nCounty, the Contractor shall take out and maintain during the life of the Contract such bodily injury, liability \nand property damage liability insurance as shall protect it and the County from claims for damages for \npersonal injury, including death, as  well as from claims for property damage, which may arise from its \nactivities under this agreement.  Such insurance shall at least have the coverages and be in the amounts set \nforth in section 15 \"Insurance and Bond Requirements \" set forth below and shall name the Board of \nSupervisors and the County as  Additional Insureds.  Such insurance must be issued by a company admitted \nwithin the Commonwealth of Virginia and with at least a Best 's Key Rating of A:V1.  The Contractor shall \nprovide the County with a ce rtificate of insurance showing such insurance to be in force and providing that \nthe insurer shall give the County at least 30 days ' notice prior to cancellation or other termination of such \ninsurance.  \n \n14.   Loss or Damage in Transit  \n \n Delivery by a contractor t o a common carrier does not constitute delivery to state agencies or \npolitical subdivisions.  Any claim for loss or damage incurred during delivery shall be between the contractor \nand the carrier.  The state accepts title only when goods are received regar dless of the F.O.B. point.  The \nreceiving agency will note all apparent damages in transit on the freight bill and notify the contractor.  \nDiscovery of concealed damages or loss will be reported by the receiving agency to the carrier and the \ncontractor wit hin seven days of receipt and prior to removal from the point of delivery if possible.  The \ncontractor shall make immediate replacement of the damaged or lost merchandise or be in default of the \ncontract.  It shall be the contractor 's responsibility to file a claim against the carrier.  If damage is to a small \nquantity, with the approval of the agency, the contractor may deduct the amount of damage or loss from his \nor her invoice to the agency in lieu of replacement.  \n \n15.   Freight  \n \n By signing an I .F.B. the bidd er certifies that the bid price(s) offered for F.O.B. destination include \nonly the actual freight charges at the lowest and best rate and is based upon the actual weight of the goods to \nbe shipped.  Freight charges are, therefore, established for each indi vidual purchase.  If a requirement is bid \nF.O.B. origin, the contractor shall prepay the charges and add the amount to the invoice.  A copy of the \nfreight bill should be attached to all invoices that include freight charges.  In a solicitation specifying F .O.B. \norigin the state will consider freight cost in the evaluation of bids.  \n \n16.   Termination for Default    \n \nIn case of default by a contractor for failure to deliver or perform in accordance with the contract \nspecifications or terms and conditions, the County  may procure the articles or services from other sources and \nhold the defaulting contractor responsible for any resulting additional purchase and administrative costs.  The \nCounty will normally repurchase from the next low bidder or purchase competitively by resolicitation.  If the \nrepurchase results in increased costs to the County, a letter will be sent to the defaulted contractor required \npayment for additional costs.  When repayment is requested, the contractor will be removed from future \nbidding until the repayment has occurred.  Contractors shall not be liable for any excess cost if the failure to \nperform arises out of any act of war, order of legal authority, strikes, act of God, or other unavoidable causes ",
        " \n 1. The Contrac tor shall purchase and maintain insurance coverage on his tools, equipment \nand machinery and shall waive subrogation to the County for damage thereto.  \n \n 2. The County reserves the right to require insurance of any Contractor in greater amounts \nprovided not ice of such requirements is stated in the Solicitation.  \n \n18.   Assignment of Contract  \n \n The contract shall not be assignable by the Contractor in whole or in part without the written \nconsent of the County.  \n \n19.   Execution  \n \n All work performed shall be in accordance w ith all local, state and federal codes, laws and \nregulations, including but not limited to: Virginia Conflict of Interest Act, Virginia Fair Employment \nContracting Act, Virginia Freedom of Information Act, Virginia Prompt Payment Act, and the Virginia \nPublic Procurement Act.  \n \n20.   No Waiver  \n \n Any failure of the County to demand rigid adherence to one or more of this Agreement 's \nprovisions in the contract, on one or more occasions, shall not be construed as a waiver nor deprive the \nCounty of the right to insist upon strict compliance with the terms of this Contract.  Any waiver of a term \nof this Contract, in whole or in part, must be in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver to be \neffective.  \n \n \n21.   Termination and Cancellation  \n \n The County shall have the u nilateral right to terminate this contract for default, in the event that \nany one or more of the following events of default occur or continue during the term of this agreement:  (a) \nthe Contractor shall fail to deliver the equipment or services required b y this contract or, (b) the Contractor \nshall repeatedly fail to respond to request for maintenance or other services within the time limits set forth \nin the contract or, (c) the Contractor shall breach any of the other cures after receiving a \" Show Cause \nNotice \" identifying the failure, then providing the Contractor ten (10) days to cure the \nfailure/nonperformance.  \n \n If the Contractor fails to answer the cure notice, or does not correct the deficiencies noted, the \nCounty may immediately terminate the agreem ent for default.  In such event the County will only be liable \nfor cost incurred to the date of termination.  All costs of de -installation and return of the equipment will be \nat the Contractor 's expense.  The County 's failure to exercise its right to termi nate for default under this \nprovision shall not be construed as a waiver of its right to terminate, rescind or revoke this contract in the \nevent of any subsequent breach of any provisions of this agreement.  \n \n The County has the right to terminate the agree ment in whole or in part of convenience and shall \nrequire no breach of contract by the offeror as a condition of termination.  This right of termination for \nconvenience may be exercised at the sole unconditional discretion of the County.  If the contract i s \nterminated in whole or in part for the convenience of the County, the Contractor shall be paid for the \nservice done and the remaining buyout of the lease to the date of termination, but shall not be paid any \nother fees or lost profits.  \n \n22.   Work Site Damages  \n \n Any damages, including damage to finished surfaces, resulting from the performance of this \ncontract shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the County at the Contractor 's expense.

If necessary, control sets will b e tailored (modified) in response to  \nincreased risk from changes in threats or vulnerabilities, or variations in risk  \ntolerance.

Periodic assessment of the  \nquality of security controls implementation against performance indicators, such  \nas:  security incidents; Government exercises; and o perational evaluations will be  \nconducted by the Government, with the assistance of the Contractor.  In addition, the Contractor will conduct internal assessments when system changes are being  \nconsidered, to determine the risk of the changes.  The Contractor  must report any  \nsignificant change in the security posture of the system, and recommended  \nmitigations, immediately to the Government\u2019s ISSM.

The contractor will then invoice  \nthis set amount o f fee in each invoice as long as their EAC remains under or equal to the agreed upon \ntarget cost.      \n \n7.2 Incentive #2:  Performance ( 0-5% Gateway Incentive ) \nThe contractor is eligible to earn up to 5% fee for delivering an AFATDS 7.0 baseline that opera tionally  \ndemonstrates it meets all baseline requirements as outlined in the AFATDS Software Requirements \nSpecification (SRS) by the end of the CLIN 0001 PoP.  The 5% fee allocated to this incentive is based \nupon the agreed upon target cost and does no t increase/decrease if the contractor realizes a target cost  \nunderrun/overrun.  The fee available for this incentive  will be set at time of awar d based upon the agreed \nupon target cost and available target fee.   \n \nThis incentive is a  Gateway Fee incentive that b uilds off of initial and continued superior performanc e.  \nThe Government will assess performance at defined \u201cGates\u201d (as described below).  If the contractor  \nsuccessfully meets the performance parameters at each Gate, they earn fee.  In addition, if the con tractor  \nsequentiall y meets the performance parameters of Gates 1, 2, and 3, they are eligible to earn a flat fee \nbonus.  If the contractor does not successively pass Gates 1, 2, and 3 they forfeit their opportunity to  \nearn the flat fee bonu s.  Forfeiting t he flat fee bonus for not successively passing Gates 1, 2, and 3  does \nnot impact the contractor\u2019s ability to earn fee at the Final Gate.   \n \nIn alignment with the Statement of Objectives, paragraph, 6.15, the contractor is to deliver engineer  \nreleases starti ng 120 calendar days after contract award and every 60 days thereafter.  It is anticipated  \nthere will be a total of 10 engineering releases and 1 final release throughout the PoP of CLIN 0001.  \n Therefore, the defined Gates for this incentive will focus on a subset of those engineering releases and are \nas stated below:   \nGate 1  - Engineering Release 3   \nGate 2  - Engineering Release 6   \nGate 3  - Engineering Release 9   \nFinal Gate  - AFATDS 7.0 Baseline Release  \n \n Gate 1 (Engineering Release 3), Gate 2 (Engineering Release 6), and Gate 3 (Engineering  \nRelease 9)   \nThe contractor is eligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool for engineering releases 3, 6, and 9  \n(for a total of 30% of the available 5% fee pool i f each gate is achieved successfully).  The contractor is \neligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool at each Gate if the engineering release is delivered to the \nGovernment with n o Priority 1 or 2 errors; no exceptions.  Priority levels are as define d in the AFATDS  \nSRS.  There is no limit on Priority 3 or 4 error rates.  The data used to substantiate this performance  \nassessment will be the contractor\u2019s testing data supplied in the applicable CDRL  A035 \u2013 Software Test  \nDescription.   \n \n Gates 1, 2, and 3 Successively Superior Flat Fee  \nThe contractor is eligible to earn 20% of the available 5% fee pool as a flat fee bonus for successively  \nmeeting Gates 1, 2, and 3, as defined above.  Therefore, if the contractor delivers  all thre e engineering  \nreleases (engineering releases 3, 6, and 9) with  no Priority 1 or 2 errors, they are eligible for the flat fee  \nbonus; no exceptions.  \n \nAs stated under Gates 1, 2, and 3, the priority levels are as defined in the AFATDS SRS.

The origin of this  \nrequirement is that HTML5 is the agreed upon common standard for web \nbased applications running within MCE and will likewise support runni ng \nin the CPCE framework . \n b.

Normally, price reasonableness is established through cost and  \nprice analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.  The Government will determine  \ncompleteness of the offeror's proposal by verifying that all solicitation requirements have been  \npriced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs are presented in a clear and useful format.  The \nGovernment will evaluate offerors' proposed costs for reasonableness, completeness, affordability and realism.   \n \n6.1 General Instructions   \n \n6.1.1 Cost  Reasonableness, Realism, and Completeness   \nThis section is to assist you in submitting cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the  \nreasonableness, completeness, realism, balance, and/or affordability of your proposed cost.  The  \nGovernment will v erify that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly  \ncalculated, and prices are presented in a clear and useful format.  Note that unrealistically low or  \nhigh proposed costs, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for elimina ting a proposal from  \ncompetition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has  \nsubmitted an unrealistic proposal.  Additionally, unbalanced costs pose an unacceptable risk to \nthe Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror\u2019s proposal.

All information relating to the  \nproposed price, including all required supporting documentation must be included in the section \nof the proposal designated as the Cost/Price Volume.  Under no circumstances shall this  \ninformation and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal . \n \nLabor and overhead rates should include sufficient detail to sustain a DCAA audit (e.g., direct  \nlabor rates, overhead, fring e benefits, General and Administrative Expense (G&A), fee, etc.).   \n The offeror must provide the basis of estimate for all rates with detailed rationale to support the  \nrates.  For indirect rates, the preferred method for providing support detail is throug h the \nsubmission of a Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) or Forward Pricing Rate  \nRecommendation (FPRR).  However, in the absence of a FPRA/FPRR, the Government will  \naccept all rates and factors by year utilized in the development of the Forward Pricing R ate \nProposal and the basis for these rates and factors (e.g., breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data).  If the contractor is not required to maintain forward pricing rates then the Government will  \naccept other methods of validation.  These methods include  approved provisional billing rates, \nother submitted/approved rates, or the submission of proposed rate calculations (including the  \npools & bases) and the basis of all calculations (e.g., breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data).

In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  The past per formance evaluation factor  \nassesses the degree of confidence the Government has in an offeror\u2019s ability to supply products  \nand services that meet users\u2019 needs, based on a demonstrated record of performance.

The information submitted shall reference only  \nthe offeror\u2019s, significant teaming partner\u2019s, or significant subcontractor\u2019s past performance on \nthe submitte d effort, rather than the past performance of other contractors on the submitted \neffort.   \n \nPast performance information shall be obtained from any other sources available to the  \nGovernment, to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information R etrieval System  \n(PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System, Electronic Subcontract Reporting System, or other databases; interviews with program managers, contracting officers, and fee determining officials; and the Defense Cont ract Management  \nAgency.  \n \n (1) Recency Assessmen t \nAn assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  Recent contracts are considered to be efforts that the prime offeror and its teaming partners, joint  \nventure or s ignificant subcontractors have performed within the past five years prior to original  \nissuance of the solicitation, or for ongoing efforts the period of performance of which must have  \nstarted at least nine months before the original proposal due date.  Pa st performance information  \nthat fails this condition will not be further evaluate d.      \n \n (2) Relevancy Assessmen t \nThe Government will conduct an i n-depth evaluation of all recent performance information \nobtained.
