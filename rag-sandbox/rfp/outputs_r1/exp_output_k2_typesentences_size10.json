The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and  then the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork  together in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a  Guaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately  from the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained. 2."

To  date, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making  process.

        "1. 5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE   The Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets. Both the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are  already meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area. The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local  newspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design. The building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant. The revitalization will undoubtedly alter  the deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper  industry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an  accessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers. The  Tribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance. The Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids. \uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A."

        "5 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI)/OCI MITIGATION PLA N    a. An organizational conflict of interest means that because of othe r activities or   relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render   impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a perso n has an   unfair competitive advantage. The Government seeks to acquire unbiased advi ce  and/or goods and services from offerors/contractors that are free from, or have   mitigated, Organizational Conflicts of Interest , as defined in FAR 2. 101, relating to this contract . b. In order for the Government to try to prevent an OCI relating to this contract, the   parties  to this contract agree that the contractor\u2019s future contracting with the   Government may be restricted as outlined in FAR Subpart 9. 5, if the   offeror/ contractor and DISA are unable to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate actual or   potential OCI before contract award . c. DISA will not automatically exclude a vendor from a competitive acquisition due to   an actual or potential OCI. The Contracting Office is comm itted to working with   potential vendors to eliminate or mitigate actual and potential OCI situations, without detriment to the integrity of the competitive process, the DISA mission, or the   legitimate business interests of the vendor community .",
        "As appropriate , this section needs to contain:     a. Identification of Possible Follo w-on Wor k. Not applicable . b. Identification of Potential Conflicts of Interest (COI ). Organizational COI is a situation where   because of other relationships or activities a person (company)  is unable or potentially unable to  render impartial assistance or advice to the Government or cannot objectively perform contract work   or has an unfair competitive advantage. FAR 9. 502 states that \u201can organization COI may result when  factors create an ac tual or potential conflict of interest on an instant contract, or when the nature of   the work to be performed on the instant contract creates an actual or potential COI on a future   acquisition. \u201d  An organizational COI exists when the nature of the work to b e performed may, without   some restriction on future activities, (1) result in an unfair competitive advantage to the contractor on  other contracts or (2) impair the contractor\u2019s objectivity in performing the contract work. The   primary burden is on the con tractor to identify any organizational COI, however, the Government has   the responsibility to identify and evaluate such conflicts."
