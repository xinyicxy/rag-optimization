        "is \u201c Construction Manager at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133 based contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase. 1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND The Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the historic Tribune Building along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To date, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making process. As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new economy and co mmunity that works well for all. Page 2 To that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local economy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational rentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the functional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow human talent simultaneous to the local economy. The Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the value and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment that fosters and accepts failure; creativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship. 1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT In 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of Consolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more than a century. At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce. The dramatic economic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency would not serve their changed circumstances. The Tribune Building Project",
        "seeks to support residents in determining their own identity. By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the com munity\u2019s future. 1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE The Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets. Both the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are already meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area. The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local newspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design. The building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant. The revitalization will undoubtedly alter the deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper industry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an accessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers. The Tribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown and riverfront renaissance. The Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids. \uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A. \uf0b7 An Estimate of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \uf0b7 A Project Timeline is provided in Exhi bit C.

        "is \u201c Construction Manager at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133 based contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase. 1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND The Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the historic Tribune Building along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To date, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making process. As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new economy and co mmunity that works well for all. Page 2 To that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local economy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational rentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the functional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow human talent simultaneous to the local economy. The Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the value and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment that fosters and accepts failure; creativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship. 1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT In 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of Consolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more than a century. At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce. The dramatic economic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency would not serve their changed circumstances. The Tribune Building Project",
        "seeks to support residents in determining their own identity. By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the com munity\u2019s future. 1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE The Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets. Both the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are already meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area. The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local newspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design. The building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant. The revitalization will undoubtedly alter the deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper industry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an accessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers. The Tribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown and riverfront renaissance. The Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids. \uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A. \uf0b7 An Estimate of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \uf0b7 A Project Timeline is provided in Exhi bit C. All Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP. 1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American Institute of Architects) Construction Management at -risk is a process that allows the Owner of a Project to choose the Construction Manager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and then the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork together"

Additionally, unbalanced costs pose an unacceptable risk to the Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror\u2019s proposal. Cost submissions should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness and be adequate enough to support and sustain a DCAA audit. 6.1.2 Cost/Price Information Information beyond that required by this instruction shall not be submitted, unless you consider it essential to document or support your cost/price position. All information relating to the proposed price, including all required supporting documentation must be included in the section of the proposal designated as the Cost/Price Volume. Under no circumstances shall this information and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal . Labor and overhead rates should include sufficient detail to sustain a DCAA audit (e.g., direct labor rates, overhead, fring e benefits, General and Administrative Expense (G&A), fee, etc.). The offeror must provide the basis of estimate for all rates with detailed rationale to support the rates. For indirect rates, the preferred method for providing support detail is throug h the submission of a Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) or Forward Pricing Rate Recommendation (FPRR). However, in the absence of a FPRA/FPRR, the Government will accept all rates and factors by year utilized in the development of the Forward Pricing R ate Proposal and the basis for these rates and factors (e.g., breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data).

Normally, price reasonableness is established through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.
