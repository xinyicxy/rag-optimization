(\u201cIncourage\u201d)  located in rural central Wisconsin, invites proposals  from \ninterested firms  for Construction Management services on the Tribune Building Project (located at 220 First \nAvenue South, Wisconsin Rapids).  \n\nSubmission Deadline:      Friday, February 13, 2015  at 4:0 0 p.m. CST  \n  \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \n1 Project Information  \n2 Scope of Services \u2013 Construction Manager \u2019s Responsibilities  \n3 Owner\u2019s Responsibilities  \n4 Insurance and Bonds  \n5 Proposal Format  \n6 Proposal Submittal  \n7 Proposer \u2019s Site Visit &  Q&A Session  \n8 Final Selection  \n9 Additional Information Requests  \n  \n1. PROJECT INFORMATION  \n\n1.1   ABOUT INCOURAGE  \nEstablished in 1994, Incourage Community Foundation is a nationally recognized leader in place -based \nphilanthropy and community change efforts.  Incourage operates with a vision of a community that works well for \nall people. To achieve this vision, values of equity, inclusion and opportunity are applied to all work, and to the \nrelationships Incourage fosters to accomplish its work. To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and \nsubcontractors who:  \n\n\uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius;  \n\uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work;  \n\uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work;  \n\uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place;  \n\uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to \ncorporate social responsibility.  \n\nIncourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement  services under an AIA A133 contract \nstructure with  a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this  \nRFP (the  \u201cProject\u201d  and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) . The selected Proposer will become the \nConstruction Manager  (CM).  \n\n1.2 DELIVERY METHOD  \nThe delivery method for the Project is \u201c Construction Manager  at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133 \nbased contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase.    \n\n1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND  \nThe Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the \nhistoric Tribune Building  along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To \ndate, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making \nprocess.  As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new \neconomy and co mmunity that works well for all.  \nPage 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n\n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n\nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n\n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.  ",

The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n\n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2. The Owner and Construction Manager  \nmay agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of \nthe Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall \nidentify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project.   Page 3 \nThe Construction Manager  will be required to hold a Construction Manager s\u2019 license  (or applicable license)  valid \nfor the State of Wisconsin . \n\n2.1 PRECONSTRUCTION PHASE  \n\n Consultation  \nThe Construction Manager  shall meet with the Architect and Owner to discuss such matters as procedures, \nprogress, coord ination, and scheduling of th e work. The Construction Manager  shall advise the Owner and the \nArchitect on proposed site use and improvements , selection of materials, and building systems and equipment. \nThe Construction Manager  shall also provide recommendations consistent with the Pro ject requirements to the \nOwner and Architect on constructability; availability of materials and labor; time requirements for procurement, \ninstallation and construction; and factors related to construction cos t including, but not limited to:  costs of \naltern ative designs or materials, preliminary budgets, life -cycle data, and possible cost reductions.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall provide recommendations with regard to accelerated or fast -track scheduling, \nprocurement, or phased construction. The Construction Manager  shall take into consideration cost reductions, \ncost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction \nscheduling issues.   \n\nPreliminary  Cost  Estimates  \nBased on the preliminary design and  other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate  of Probable \nCost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager  suggests alternative materials and systems, the \nConstruction Manager  shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems.  \n\nAs the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design  Documents, the Construction Manager  shall \nprepare  estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further \ndevelopment of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager  agree on a Guaranteed \nMaximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s \napproval  prior to the completion of each phase . The Construction Manage r shall inform the Owner and Architect \nwhen estimates of the Cost of the Work exceed the latest approved Project budget and make recommendations \nfor corrective action.   ",
        "Guaranteed  Maximum  Price  Proposal  and Contract  Time  \nAt a time to be mutually agreed up on by the Owner and the Construction Manager  and in consultation with the \nArchitect, the Construction Manager  shall prepare a detailed line item  Guaranteed Maximum Price Proposal for \nthe Owner\u2019s review and acceptance.  The Guaranteed Maximum Price in the pr oposal shall be the sum of the \nConstruction Manager \u2019s estimate of the Cost of the Work and the Construction Manager \u2019s Fee for the \nConstruction Phase as quoted in the Proposer\u2019s response to this RFP.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall include with the Guarant eed Maximum Price proposal a written statement of its \nbasis, which shall include the following:  \n 1. A list of the Drawings and Specifications, including all Addenda thereto, and the Conditions of the \nContract;  \n 2. A list of the clarifications and assumptions made by the Construction Manager  in the preparation of \nthe Guaranteed Maximum Price proposal,  \n 3. A statement of the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price, including a statement of the estimated \nCost of the Work organized by trade categories or systems, allowances, contingency, and the \nConstruction Manager \u2019s Fee;  \n 4. A schedule of milestones for the comple tion and the anticipated date of Substantial Completion upon \nwhich the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price is based;  \n 5. A Schedule of Value for each component of work to be undertaken; and \n 6. A date by which the Owner must accept the Guaranteed Maximum Pr ice.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall meet with the Owner and Architect to review the Guaranteed Maximum Price \nproposal.  Once a Guaranteed Maximum Price has been agreed upon by all parties, the Owner and Construction \nManager  shall execute the Guaranteed M aximum Price Amendment to the Contract.  The Guaranteed Maximum Page 4 \nPrice Amendment shall set forth the agreed upon Guaranteed Maximum Price with the information and \nassumptions upon which it is based  and shall include a Schedule of Values .  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall guarantee that the Contract Sum shall not exceed the Guaranteed Maximum \nPrice set forth in the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment, as it is amended from time to time.  To the extent \nthe Cost of the Work exceeds the Guaranteed Maximum Price, t he Construction Manager  shall bear such costs in \nexcess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price without reimbursement or additional compensation from the Owner.   \nThe Construction Manager will acknowledge that the Construction Manager is an experienced contractor a nd \nthat (subject to Acts of God) the Project can be completed for Guaranteed Maximum Price.  \n\nSubcontractors  and Suppliers  \nThose portions of the Work that the Construction Manager  does not customarily perform with the Construction \nManager \u2019s own personnel s hall be performed under subcontracts or by other appropriate agreements with the \nConstruction Manager . The Owner may designate specific persons from whom, or entities from which, the \nConstruction Manager  shall obtain bids. Subcontractors must be located 50 miles  or less from the Project site , \nunless a greater distance is approved by the Owner.  The Construction Manager  shall obtain at least three \nproposals from Subcontractors and from suppliers of materials or equipment fabricated especially for the Work \nand shall deliver suc h proposals  to the Owner. The Owner shall then determine, with the advice of the \nConstruction Manager  and the Architect, which bids will be accepted. The Construction Manager  shall not be \nrequired to contract with anyone to whom the Const ruction Manager  has reasonable objection.  \n\nIf the Guaranteed Maximum Price has been established and a specifi c subcontractor or supplier  (1) is \nrecommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager , (2) is qualified to perform that portion of the Work, \nand (3) has submitted a  proposal  that conforms to the requirements of the Contract Documents without \nreservations or exceptions, but the Owner requires that another  proposal  be accepted, then the Construction \nManager  may require that a Change Order be issued t o adjust the Guaranteed Maximum Price by the difference \nbetween the bid of the person or entity recommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager  and the \nproposal  of  the person or entity designated by the Owner.  \n\n2.2 CONSTRUCTION PHASE  \n\nThe Construction Phase shall commence upon the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment or \nthe Owner\u2019s issuance of a Notice to Proceed, whichever occurs earlier.  \n\nChanges  in the Work  \nThe Owner may, without invalidating the Contract, order changes in  the Work within the general scope of the \nContract consisting of additions, deletions or other revisions. The Architect  shall issue such changes in writing  \nand all change orders will be signed and acknowledged by Owner and Construction Manager . The Constru ction \nManager  shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the Contract Time as a result of changes in the Work.  \n\nChange orders issued by the Owner subsequent to the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment \nshall constitute adjustments to the  Guaranteed Maximum Price.

To \ndate, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making \nprocess.  As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new \neconomy and co mmunity that works well for all.  \nPage 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n\n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n\nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n\n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.

The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n\n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2. The Owner and Construction Manager  \nmay agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of \nthe Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall \nidentify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project.   Page 3 \nThe Construction Manager  will be required to hold a Construction Manager s\u2019 license  (or applicable license)  valid \nfor the State of Wisconsin . \n\n2.1 PRECONSTRUCTION PHASE  \n\n Consultation  \nThe Construction Manager  shall meet with the Architect and Owner to discuss such matters as procedures, \nprogress, coord ination, and scheduling of th e work. The Construction Manager  shall advise the Owner and the \nArchitect on proposed site use and improvements , selection of materials, and building systems and equipment. \nThe Construction Manager  shall also provide recommendations consistent with the Pro ject requirements to the \nOwner and Architect on constructability; availability of materials and labor; time requirements for procurement, \ninstallation and construction; and factors related to construction cos t including, but not limited to:  costs of \naltern ative designs or materials, preliminary budgets, life -cycle data, and possible cost reductions.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall provide recommendations with regard to accelerated or fast -track scheduling, \nprocurement, or phased construction. The Construction Manager  shall take into consideration cost reductions, \ncost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction \nscheduling issues.   \n\nPreliminary  Cost  Estimates  \nBased on the preliminary design and  other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate  of Probable \nCost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager  suggests alternative materials and systems, the \nConstruction Manager  shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems.  \n\nAs the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design  Documents, the Construction Manager  shall \nprepare  estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further \ndevelopment of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager  agree on a Guaranteed \nMaximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s \napproval  prior to the completion of each phase . The Construction Manage r shall inform the Owner and Architect \nwhen estimates of the Cost of the Work exceed the latest approved Project budget and make recommendations \nfor corrective action.   "

The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n\n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2. The Owner and Construction Manager  \nmay agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of \nthe Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall \nidentify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project.   Page 3 \nThe Construction Manager  will be required to hold a Construction Manager s\u2019 license  (or applicable license)  valid \nfor the State of Wisconsin . \n\n2.1 PRECONSTRUCTION PHASE  \n\n Consultation  \nThe Construction Manager  shall meet with the Architect and Owner to discuss such matters as procedures, \nprogress, coord ination, and scheduling of th e work. The Construction Manager  shall advise the Owner and the \nArchitect on proposed site use and improvements , selection of materials, and building systems and equipment. \nThe Construction Manager  shall also provide recommendations consistent with the Pro ject requirements to the \nOwner and Architect on constructability; availability of materials and labor; time requirements for procurement, \ninstallation and construction; and factors related to construction cos t including, but not limited to:  costs of \naltern ative designs or materials, preliminary budgets, life -cycle data, and possible cost reductions.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall provide recommendations with regard to accelerated or fast -track scheduling, \nprocurement, or phased construction. The Construction Manager  shall take into consideration cost reductions, \ncost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction \nscheduling issues.   \n\nPreliminary  Cost  Estimates  \nBased on the preliminary design and  other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate  of Probable \nCost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager  suggests alternative materials and systems, the \nConstruction Manager  shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems.  \n\nAs the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design  Documents, the Construction Manager  shall \nprepare  estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further \ndevelopment of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager  agree on a Guaranteed \nMaximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s \napproval  prior to the completion of each phase . The Construction Manage r shall inform the Owner and Architect \nwhen estimates of the Cost of the Work exceed the latest approved Project budget and make recommendations \nfor corrective action.   ",
        "Guaranteed  Maximum  Price  Proposal  and Contract  Time  \nAt a time to be mutually agreed up on by the Owner and the Construction Manager  and in consultation with the \nArchitect, the Construction Manager  shall prepare a detailed line item  Guaranteed Maximum Price Proposal for \nthe Owner\u2019s review and acceptance.  The Guaranteed Maximum Price in the pr oposal shall be the sum of the \nConstruction Manager \u2019s estimate of the Cost of the Work and the Construction Manager \u2019s Fee for the \nConstruction Phase as quoted in the Proposer\u2019s response to this RFP.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall include with the Guarant eed Maximum Price proposal a written statement of its \nbasis, which shall include the following:  \n 1. A list of the Drawings and Specifications, including all Addenda thereto, and the Conditions of the \nContract;  \n 2. A list of the clarifications and assumptions made by the Construction Manager  in the preparation of \nthe Guaranteed Maximum Price proposal,  \n 3. A statement of the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price, including a statement of the estimated \nCost of the Work organized by trade categories or systems, allowances, contingency, and the \nConstruction Manager \u2019s Fee;  \n 4. A schedule of milestones for the comple tion and the anticipated date of Substantial Completion upon \nwhich the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price is based;  \n 5. A Schedule of Value for each component of work to be undertaken; and \n 6. A date by which the Owner must accept the Guaranteed Maximum Pr ice.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall meet with the Owner and Architect to review the Guaranteed Maximum Price \nproposal.  Once a Guaranteed Maximum Price has been agreed upon by all parties, the Owner and Construction \nManager  shall execute the Guaranteed M aximum Price Amendment to the Contract.  The Guaranteed Maximum Page 4 \nPrice Amendment shall set forth the agreed upon Guaranteed Maximum Price with the information and \nassumptions upon which it is based  and shall include a Schedule of Values .  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall guarantee that the Contract Sum shall not exceed the Guaranteed Maximum \nPrice set forth in the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment, as it is amended from time to time.  To the extent \nthe Cost of the Work exceeds the Guaranteed Maximum Price, t he Construction Manager  shall bear such costs in \nexcess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price without reimbursement or additional compensation from the Owner.   \nThe Construction Manager will acknowledge that the Construction Manager is an experienced contractor a nd \nthat (subject to Acts of God) the Project can be completed for Guaranteed Maximum Price.  \n\nSubcontractors  and Suppliers  \nThose portions of the Work that the Construction Manager  does not customarily perform with the Construction \nManager \u2019s own personnel s hall be performed under subcontracts or by other appropriate agreements with the \nConstruction Manager . The Owner may designate specific persons from whom, or entities from which, the \nConstruction Manager  shall obtain bids. Subcontractors must be located 50 miles  or less from the Project site , \nunless a greater distance is approved by the Owner.  The Construction Manager  shall obtain at least three \nproposals from Subcontractors and from suppliers of materials or equipment fabricated especially for the Work \nand shall deliver suc h proposals  to the Owner. The Owner shall then determine, with the advice of the \nConstruction Manager  and the Architect, which bids will be accepted. The Construction Manager  shall not be \nrequired to contract with anyone to whom the Const ruction Manager  has reasonable objection.  \n\nIf the Guaranteed Maximum Price has been established and a specifi c subcontractor or supplier  (1) is \nrecommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager , (2) is qualified to perform that portion of the Work, \nand (3) has submitted a  proposal  that conforms to the requirements of the Contract Documents without \nreservations or exceptions, but the Owner requires that another  proposal  be accepted, then the Construction \nManager  may require that a Change Order be issued t o adjust the Guaranteed Maximum Price by the difference \nbetween the bid of the person or entity recommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager  and the \nproposal  of  the person or entity designated by the Owner.  \n\n2.2 CONSTRUCTION PHASE  \n\nThe Construction Phase shall commence upon the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment or \nthe Owner\u2019s issuance of a Notice to Proceed, whichever occurs earlier.  \n\nChanges  in the Work  \nThe Owner may, without invalidating the Contract, order changes in  the Work within the general scope of the \nContract consisting of additions, deletions or other revisions. The Architect  shall issue such changes in writing  \nand all change orders will be signed and acknowledged by Owner and Construction Manager . The Constru ction \nManager  shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the Contract Time as a result of changes in the Work.  \n\nChange orders issued by the Owner subsequent to the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment \nshall constitute adjustments to the  Guaranteed Maximum Price.

The Guaranteed Maximum Price in the pr oposal shall be the sum of the \nConstruction Manager \u2019s estimate of the Cost of the Work and the Construction Manager \u2019s Fee for the \nConstruction Phase as quoted in the Proposer\u2019s response to this RFP.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall include with the Guarant eed Maximum Price proposal a written statement of its \nbasis, which shall include the following:  \n 1. A list of the Drawings and Specifications, including all Addenda thereto, and the Conditions of the \nContract;  \n 2.

A Schedule of Value for each component of work to be undertaken; and \n 6. A date by which the Owner must accept the Guaranteed Maximum Pr ice.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall meet with the Owner and Architect to review the Guaranteed Maximum Price \nproposal.  Once a Guaranteed Maximum Price has been agreed upon by all parties, the Owner and Construction \nManager  shall execute the Guaranteed M aximum Price Amendment to the Contract.  The Guaranteed Maximum Page 4 \nPrice Amendment shall set forth the agreed upon Guaranteed Maximum Price with the information and \nassumptions upon which it is based  and shall include a Schedule of Values .  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall guarantee that the Contract Sum shall not exceed the Guaranteed Maximum \nPrice set forth in the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment, as it is amended from time to time.

The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n\n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2. The Owner and Construction Manager  \nmay agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of \nthe Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall \nidentify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project.   Page 3 \nThe Construction Manager  will be required to hold a Construction Manager s\u2019 license  (or applicable license)  valid \nfor the State of Wisconsin . \n\n2.1 PRECONSTRUCTION PHASE  \n\n Consultation  \nThe Construction Manager  shall meet with the Architect and Owner to discuss such matters as procedures, \nprogress, coord ination, and scheduling of th e work. The Construction Manager  shall advise the Owner and the \nArchitect on proposed site use and improvements , selection of materials, and building systems and equipment. \nThe Construction Manager  shall also provide recommendations consistent with the Pro ject requirements to the \nOwner and Architect on constructability; availability of materials and labor; time requirements for procurement, \ninstallation and construction; and factors related to construction cos t including, but not limited to:  costs of \naltern ative designs or materials, preliminary budgets, life -cycle data, and possible cost reductions.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall provide recommendations with regard to accelerated or fast -track scheduling, \nprocurement, or phased construction. The Construction Manager  shall take into consideration cost reductions, \ncost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction \nscheduling issues.   \n\nPreliminary  Cost  Estimates  \nBased on the preliminary design and  other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate  of Probable \nCost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager  suggests alternative materials and systems, the \nConstruction Manager  shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems.  \n\nAs the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design  Documents, the Construction Manager  shall \nprepare  estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further \ndevelopment of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager  agree on a Guaranteed \nMaximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s \napproval  prior to the completion of each phase . The Construction Manage r shall inform the Owner and Architect \nwhen estimates of the Cost of the Work exceed the latest approved Project budget and make recommendations \nfor corrective action.   "

The Guaranteed Maximum Page 4 \nPrice Amendment shall set forth the agreed upon Guaranteed Maximum Price with the information and \nassumptions upon which it is based  and shall include a Schedule of Values .  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall guarantee that the Contract Sum shall not exceed the Guaranteed Maximum \nPrice set forth in the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment, as it is amended from time to time.  To the extent \nthe Cost of the Work exceeds the Guaranteed Maximum Price, t he Construction Manager  shall bear such costs in \nexcess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price without reimbursement or additional compensation from the Owner.   \nThe Construction Manager will acknowledge that the Construction Manager is an experienced contractor a nd \nthat (subject to Acts of God) the Project can be completed for Guaranteed Maximum Price.  \n\nSubcontractors  and Suppliers  \nThose portions of the Work that the Construction Manager  does not customarily perform with the Construction \nManager \u2019s own personnel s hall be performed under subcontracts or by other appropriate agreements with the \nConstruction Manager . The Owner may designate specific persons from whom, or entities from which, the \nConstruction Manager  shall obtain bids. Subcontractors must be located 50 miles  or less from the Project site , \nunless a greater distance is approved by the Owner.  The Construction Manager  shall obtain at least three \nproposals from Subcontractors and from suppliers of materials or equipment fabricated especially for the Work \nand shall deliver suc h proposals  to the Owner. The Owner shall then determine, with the advice of the \nConstruction Manager  and the Architect, which bids will be accepted. The Construction Manager  shall not be \nrequired to contract with anyone to whom the Const ruction Manager  has reasonable objection.  \n\nIf the Guaranteed Maximum Price has been established and a specifi c subcontractor or supplier  (1) is \nrecommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager , (2) is qualified to perform that portion of the Work, \nand (3) has submitted a  proposal  that conforms to the requirements of the Contract Documents without \nreservations or exceptions, but the Owner requires that another  proposal  be accepted, then the Construction \nManager  may require that a Change Order be issued t o adjust the Guaranteed Maximum Price by the difference \nbetween the bid of the person or entity recommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager  and the \nproposal  of  the person or entity designated by the Owner.  \n\n2.2 CONSTRUCTION PHASE  \n\nThe Construction Phase shall commence upon the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment or \nthe Owner\u2019s issuance of a Notice to Proceed, whichever occurs earlier.  \n\nChanges  in the Work  \nThe Owner may, without invalidating the Contract, order changes in  the Work within the general scope of the \nContract consisting of additions, deletions or other revisions. The Architect  shall issue such changes in writing  \nand all change orders will be signed and acknowledged by Owner and Construction Manager . The Constru ction \nManager  shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the Contract Time as a result of changes in the Work.  \n\nChange orders issued by the Owner subsequent to the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment \nshall constitute adjustments to the  Guaranteed Maximum Price.

The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n\n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2. The Owner and Construction Manager  \nmay agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of \nthe Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall \nidentify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project.   Page 3 \nThe Construction Manager  will be required to hold a Construction Manager s\u2019 license  (or applicable license)  valid \nfor the State of Wisconsin . \n\n2.1 PRECONSTRUCTION PHASE  \n\n Consultation  \nThe Construction Manager  shall meet with the Architect and Owner to discuss such matters as procedures, \nprogress, coord ination, and scheduling of th e work. The Construction Manager  shall advise the Owner and the \nArchitect on proposed site use and improvements , selection of materials, and building systems and equipment. \nThe Construction Manager  shall also provide recommendations consistent with the Pro ject requirements to the \nOwner and Architect on constructability; availability of materials and labor; time requirements for procurement, \ninstallation and construction; and factors related to construction cos t including, but not limited to:  costs of \naltern ative designs or materials, preliminary budgets, life -cycle data, and possible cost reductions.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall provide recommendations with regard to accelerated or fast -track scheduling, \nprocurement, or phased construction. The Construction Manager  shall take into consideration cost reductions, \ncost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction \nscheduling issues.   \n\nPreliminary  Cost  Estimates  \nBased on the preliminary design and  other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate  of Probable \nCost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager  suggests alternative materials and systems, the \nConstruction Manager  shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems.  \n\nAs the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design  Documents, the Construction Manager  shall \nprepare  estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further \ndevelopment of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager  agree on a Guaranteed \nMaximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s \napproval  prior to the completion of each phase . The Construction Manage r shall inform the Owner and Architect \nwhen estimates of the Cost of the Work exceed the latest approved Project budget and make recommendations \nfor corrective action.   "

      "llm_response": "If a contractor defaults by failing to deliver or perform as per contract specifications, the County may procure services or articles from other sources and hold the defaulting contractor responsible for any resulting additional purchase and administrative costs. The County will typically repurchase from the next low bidder or through competitive resolicitation. If the repurchase incurs increased costs, the defaulting contractor will receive a letter requesting repayment of those costs and will be barred from future bidding until the repayment is received.",

        "13.   Liability Coverage  \n\n Unless otherwise expressly excepted in the procurement announcement documents prepared by the \nCounty, the Contractor shall take out and maintain during the life of the Contract such bodily injury, liability \nand property damage liability insurance as shall protect it and the County from claims for damages for \npersonal injury, including death, as  well as from claims for property damage, which may arise from its \nactivities under this agreement.  Such insurance shall at least have the coverages and be in the amounts set \nforth in section 15 \"Insurance and Bond Requirements \" set forth below and shall name the Board of \nSupervisors and the County as  Additional Insureds.  Such insurance must be issued by a company admitted \nwithin the Commonwealth of Virginia and with at least a Best 's Key Rating of A:V1.  The Contractor shall \nprovide the County with a ce rtificate of insurance showing such insurance to be in force and providing that \nthe insurer shall give the County at least 30 days ' notice prior to cancellation or other termination of such \ninsurance.  \n\n14.   Loss or Damage in Transit  \n\n Delivery by a contractor t o a common carrier does not constitute delivery to state agencies or \npolitical subdivisions.  Any claim for loss or damage incurred during delivery shall be between the contractor \nand the carrier.  The state accepts title only when goods are received regar dless of the F.O.B. point.  The \nreceiving agency will note all apparent damages in transit on the freight bill and notify the contractor.  \nDiscovery of concealed damages or loss will be reported by the receiving agency to the carrier and the \ncontractor wit hin seven days of receipt and prior to removal from the point of delivery if possible.  The \ncontractor shall make immediate replacement of the damaged or lost merchandise or be in default of the \ncontract.  It shall be the contractor 's responsibility to file a claim against the carrier.  If damage is to a small \nquantity, with the approval of the agency, the contractor may deduct the amount of damage or loss from his \nor her invoice to the agency in lieu of replacement.  \n\n15.   Freight  \n\n By signing an I .F.B. the bidd er certifies that the bid price(s) offered for F.O.B. destination include \nonly the actual freight charges at the lowest and best rate and is based upon the actual weight of the goods to \nbe shipped.  Freight charges are, therefore, established for each indi vidual purchase.  If a requirement is bid \nF.O.B. origin, the contractor shall prepay the charges and add the amount to the invoice.  A copy of the \nfreight bill should be attached to all invoices that include freight charges.  In a solicitation specifying F .O.B. \norigin the state will consider freight cost in the evaluation of bids.  \n\n16.   Termination for Default    \n\nIn case of default by a contractor for failure to deliver or perform in accordance with the contract \nspecifications or terms and conditions, the County  may procure the articles or services from other sources and \nhold the defaulting contractor responsible for any resulting additional purchase and administrative costs.  The \nCounty will normally repurchase from the next low bidder or purchase competitively by resolicitation.  If the \nrepurchase results in increased costs to the County, a letter will be sent to the defaulted contractor required \npayment for additional costs.  When repayment is requested, the contractor will be removed from future \nbidding until the repayment has occurred.  Contractors shall not be liable for any excess cost if the failure to \nperform arises out of any act of war, order of legal authority, strikes, act of God, or other unavoidable causes   3 | Page  \nEngineering Services RFP #2020 -05-21 \n not attributed to their fault or negligence.   Failure of a contractor 's source to deliver is generally not \nconsidered to be an unavoidable cause.  The burden of proof rests with the contract.  \n\nRemainder of this page left blank.  \n\n ",
        "18.   Assignment of Contract  \n\n The contract shall not be assignable by the Contractor in whole or in part without the written \nconsent of the County.  \n\n19.   Execution  \n\n All work performed shall be in accordance w ith all local, state and federal codes, laws and \nregulations, including but not limited to: Virginia Conflict of Interest Act, Virginia Fair Employment \nContracting Act, Virginia Freedom of Information Act, Virginia Prompt Payment Act, and the Virginia \nPublic Procurement Act.  \n\n20.   No Waiver  \n\n Any failure of the County to demand rigid adherence to one or more of this Agreement 's \nprovisions in the contract, on one or more occasions, shall not be construed as a waiver nor deprive the \nCounty of the right to insist upon strict compliance with the terms of this Contract.  Any waiver of a term \nof this Contract, in whole or in part, must be in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver to be \neffective.  \n\n \n21.   Termination and Cancellation  \n\n The County shall have the u nilateral right to terminate this contract for default, in the event that \nany one or more of the following events of default occur or continue during the term of this agreement:  (a) \nthe Contractor shall fail to deliver the equipment or services required b y this contract or, (b) the Contractor \nshall repeatedly fail to respond to request for maintenance or other services within the time limits set forth \nin the contract or, (c) the Contractor shall breach any of the other cures after receiving a \" Show Cause \nNotice \" identifying the failure, then providing the Contractor ten (10) days to cure the \nfailure/nonperformance.  \n\n If the Contractor fails to answer the cure notice, or does not correct the deficiencies noted, the \nCounty may immediately terminate the agreem ent for default.  In such event the County will only be liable \nfor cost incurred to the date of termination.  All costs of de -installation and return of the equipment will be \nat the Contractor 's expense.  The County 's failure to exercise its right to termi nate for default under this \nprovision shall not be construed as a waiver of its right to terminate, rescind or revoke this contract in the \nevent of any subsequent breach of any provisions of this agreement.  \n\n The County has the right to terminate the agree ment in whole or in part of convenience and shall \nrequire no breach of contract by the offeror as a condition of termination.  This right of termination for \nconvenience may be exercised at the sole unconditional discretion of the County.  If the contract i s \nterminated in whole or in part for the convenience of the County, the Contractor shall be paid for the \nservice done and the remaining buyout of the lease to the date of termination, but shall not be paid any \nother fees or lost profits.

The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n\n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2.

The Construction Manager  shall take into consideration cost reductions, \ncost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction \nscheduling issues.   \n\nPreliminary  Cost  Estimates  \nBased on the preliminary design and  other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate  of Probable \nCost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager  suggests alternative materials and systems, the \nConstruction Manager  shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems.  \n\nAs the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design  Documents, the Construction Manager  shall \nprepare  estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further \ndevelopment of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager  agree on a Guaranteed \nMaximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s \napproval  prior to the completion of each phase .

(\u201cIncourage\u201d)  located in rural central Wisconsin, invites proposals  from \ninterested firms  for Construction Management services on the Tribune Building Project (located at 220 First \nAvenue South, Wisconsin Rapids).  \n\nSubmission Deadline:      Friday, February 13, 2015  at 4:0 0 p.m. CST  \n  \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \n1 Project Information  \n2 Scope of Services \u2013 Construction Manager \u2019s Responsibilities  \n3 Owner\u2019s Responsibilities  \n4 Insurance and Bonds  \n5 Proposal Format  \n6 Proposal Submittal  \n7 Proposer \u2019s Site Visit &  Q&A Session  \n8 Final Selection  \n9 Additional Information Requests  \n  \n1. PROJECT INFORMATION  \n\n1.1   ABOUT INCOURAGE  \nEstablished in 1994, Incourage Community Foundation is a nationally recognized leader in place -based \nphilanthropy and community change efforts.  Incourage operates with a vision of a community that works well for \nall people. To achieve this vision, values of equity, inclusion and opportunity are applied to all work, and to the \nrelationships Incourage fosters to accomplish its work. To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and \nsubcontractors who:  \n\n\uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius;  \n\uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work;  \n\uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work;  \n\uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place;  \n\uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to \ncorporate social responsibility.  \n\nIncourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement  services under an AIA A133 contract \nstructure with  a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this  \nRFP (the  \u201cProject\u201d  and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) . The selected Proposer will become the \nConstruction Manager  (CM).  \n\n1.2 DELIVERY METHOD  \nThe delivery method for the Project is \u201c Construction Manager  at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133 \nbased contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase.    \n\n1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND  \nThe Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the \nhistoric Tribune Building  along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To \ndate, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making \nprocess.  As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new \neconomy and co mmunity that works well for all.  \nPage 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n\n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n\nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n\n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.

Liability Coverage  \n\n Unless otherwise expressly excepted in the procurement announcement documents prepared by the \nCounty, the Contractor shall take out and maintain during the life of the Contract such bodily injury, liability \nand property damage liability insurance as shall protect it and the County from claims for damages for \npersonal injury, including death, as  well as from claims for property damage, which may arise from its \nactivities under this agreement.  Such insurance shall at least have the coverages and be in the amounts set \nforth in section 15 \"Insurance and Bond Requirements \" set forth below and shall name the Board of \nSupervisors and the County as  Additional Insureds.  Such insurance must be issued by a company admitted \nwithin the Commonwealth of Virginia and with at least a Best 's Key Rating of A:V1.  The Contractor shall \nprovide the County with a ce rtificate of insurance showing such insurance to be in force and providing that \nthe insurer shall give the County at least 30 days ' notice prior to cancellation or other termination of such \ninsurance.  \n\n14.   Loss or Damage in Transit  \n\n Delivery by a contractor t o a common carrier does not constitute delivery to state agencies or \npolitical subdivisions.  Any claim for loss or damage incurred during delivery shall be between the contractor \nand the carrier.  The state accepts title only when goods are received regar dless of the F.O.B. point.  The \nreceiving agency will note all apparent damages in transit on the freight bill and notify the contractor.  \nDiscovery of concealed damages or loss will be reported by the receiving agency to the carrier and the \ncontractor wit hin seven days of receipt and prior to removal from the point of delivery if possible.  The \ncontractor shall make immediate replacement of the damaged or lost merchandise or be in default of the \ncontract.  It shall be the contractor 's responsibility to file a claim against the carrier.  If damage is to a small \nquantity, with the approval of the agency, the contractor may deduct the amount of damage or loss from his \nor her invoice to the agency in lieu of replacement.  \n\n15.   Freight  \n\n By signing an I .F.B. the bidd er certifies that the bid price(s) offered for F.O.B. destination include \nonly the actual freight charges at the lowest and best rate and is based upon the actual weight of the goods to \nbe shipped.  Freight charges are, therefore, established for each indi vidual purchase.  If a requirement is bid \nF.O.B. origin, the contractor shall prepay the charges and add the amount to the invoice.  A copy of the \nfreight bill should be attached to all invoices that include freight charges.  In a solicitation specifying F .O.B. \norigin the state will consider freight cost in the evaluation of bids.  \n\n16.   Termination for Default    \n\nIn case of default by a contractor for failure to deliver or perform in accordance with the contract \nspecifications or terms and conditions, the County  may procure the articles or services from other sources and \nhold the defaulting contractor responsible for any resulting additional purchase and administrative costs.  The \nCounty will normally repurchase from the next low bidder or purchase competitively by resolicitation.  If the \nrepurchase results in increased costs to the County, a letter will be sent to the defaulted contractor required \npayment for additional costs.  When repayment is requested, the contractor will be removed from future \nbidding until the repayment has occurred.  Contractors shall not be liable for any excess cost if the failure to \nperform arises out of any act of war, order of legal authority, strikes, act of God, or other unavoidable causes   3 | Page  \nEngineering Services RFP #2020 -05-21 \n not attributed to their fault or negligence.

        "18.   Assignment of Contract  \n\n The contract shall not be assignable by the Contractor in whole or in part without the written \nconsent of the County.  \n\n19.   Execution  \n\n All work performed shall be in accordance w ith all local, state and federal codes, laws and \nregulations, including but not limited to: Virginia Conflict of Interest Act, Virginia Fair Employment \nContracting Act, Virginia Freedom of Information Act, Virginia Prompt Payment Act, and the Virginia \nPublic Procurement Act.  \n\n20.   No Waiver  \n\n Any failure of the County to demand rigid adherence to one or more of this Agreement 's \nprovisions in the contract, on one or more occasions, shall not be construed as a waiver nor deprive the \nCounty of the right to insist upon strict compliance with the terms of this Contract.  Any waiver of a term \nof this Contract, in whole or in part, must be in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver to be \neffective.  \n\n \n21.   Termination and Cancellation  \n\n The County shall have the u nilateral right to terminate this contract for default, in the event that \nany one or more of the following events of default occur or continue during the term of this agreement:  (a) \nthe Contractor shall fail to deliver the equipment or services required b y this contract or, (b) the Contractor \nshall repeatedly fail to respond to request for maintenance or other services within the time limits set forth \nin the contract or, (c) the Contractor shall breach any of the other cures after receiving a \" Show Cause \nNotice \" identifying the failure, then providing the Contractor ten (10) days to cure the \nfailure/nonperformance.  \n\n If the Contractor fails to answer the cure notice, or does not correct the deficiencies noted, the \nCounty may immediately terminate the agreem ent for default.  In such event the County will only be liable \nfor cost incurred to the date of termination.  All costs of de -installation and return of the equipment will be \nat the Contractor 's expense.  The County 's failure to exercise its right to termi nate for default under this \nprovision shall not be construed as a waiver of its right to terminate, rescind or revoke this contract in the \nevent of any subsequent breach of any provisions of this agreement.  \n\n The County has the right to terminate the agree ment in whole or in part of convenience and shall \nrequire no breach of contract by the offeror as a condition of termination.  This right of termination for \nconvenience may be exercised at the sole unconditional discretion of the County.  If the contract i s \nterminated in whole or in part for the convenience of the County, the Contractor shall be paid for the \nservice done and the remaining buyout of the lease to the date of termination, but shall not be paid any \nother fees or lost profits.

The security plan should inc lude implementation status, responsible entities, resources, and \nestimated completion dates. Security plans may also include, but are not limited  \nto, a compiled list of system characteristics or qualities required for system registration, key securit y-related documents such as a risk assessment, privacy  \nimpact assessment, system interconnection agreements, contingency plan, security  \nconfigurations, configuration management plan, and incident response plan.   \n\n6.12.2 Subtask 2  Categorize Syste m \nThe Contractor wil l support Step 1 of the RMF, categorize the system.  The  \nsystem has the following RMF Categorization levels:  Confidentiality:  Medium; Integrity:  High; Availability:  High.  The results of the system categorization will be documented in the SSP.  The sys tem categorization is a coordinated effort  \nbetween the Contractor and the Government\u2019s cybersecurity team.   The system  \nwill be described (including system boundary) and documented in the SSP.  The  \nGovernment has the responsibility of registering the syste m in the enterprise  \nMission Assurance Support Service (eMASS).  After the Government registers  HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  37 of 217 \n\n the system in eMASS the Contractor will be responsible for inputting data into the  \neMASS system, as outlined in the following sections . \n\n6.12.3 Subtask 3  Select Securi ty Control s \n\nThe Contractor will support Step 2 of the RMF to select appropriate security  \ncontrols based on the system categorization.  The Contractor will assist the  \nGovernment in the selection of appropriate controls by identification of the  \nsecurity con trol baseline for the system, and documenting these in the SSP.  \nBaseline controls and control overlays will be tailored for the system.  Overlays  \nmay add or subtract security controls, or provide additional guidance regarding  \nsecurity controls, resulting i n a set of security controls applicable to the system  \nthat is a combination of the baseline and overlay.  The combination of baselines  \nand overlays address the unique security protection needs associated with the  \nsystem.  If necessary, control sets will b e tailored (modified) in response to  \nincreased risk from changes in threats or vulnerabilities, or variations in risk  \ntolerance.  Tailoring decisions must be coordinated with the Government, and \naligned with operational considerations and the system environ ment.  Security  \ncontrols will be added or removed only as a function of specified, ris k-based  \ndeterminations.  Tailoring decisions, including the specific rationale (e.g., mapping to risk tolerance) for those decisions, will be documented in the security  \nplan for the system.  A monitoring strategy must be developed and documented as  \na syste m-level strategy for the continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of  \nsecurity controls employed within or inherited by the system, and monitoring of  \nany proposed or ac tual changes to the system and its environment of operation.  \nThe strategy must include the plan for annual assessments of a subset of  \nimplemented security controls, and the level of independence required of the  \nassessor (e.g., Information System Security M anager (ISSM) or Security Control  \nAssessor (SCA)).  The breadth, depth, and rigor of these annual assessments will  \nbe reflective of the security categorization of the system and threats to the system.  Delivery of the security control selection will consis t of input into the eMASS  \nsystem on SIPRNET . \n\n6.12.4 Subtask 4  Implement Security Control s \n\nThe Contractor will support Step 3 of RMF, implementation of security controls.  \nThe system (including applications) will be configured in accordance with \napplicable Secu rity Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) which are \ncoordinated with the Government ISSM and SCA.  STIGs are produc t-specific  \nand document applicable DoD policies and security requirements, as well as best  \npractices and configuration guidelines.  STIGs  are associated with security  \ncontrols through Control Correlation Identifier (CCIs), which are decompositions  \nof National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication \n(SP) 80 0-53 security controls (as amplified by Committee on National Security  \nSystems 1253) into single, actionable, measurable items.  Security Requirements  \nGuide (SRG) is developed by Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  38 of 217 \n\n provide general security compliance guidelines and serve as source guidance \ndocuments for STI Gs.  When a STIG is not available for a product, an SRG may  \nbe used.  STIGs, SRGs and CCIs are available on the Information Assurance (IA)  \nSupport Environment Website (https://iase.disa.mil).  STIG and SRG compliance  \nresults for products will be documented as security control assessment results  \nwithin the security assessment report and reviewed by the PM MC responsible  \nISSM.  The Contractor will coordinate the selection of applicable STIG, SRG, \nand CCI with the Government\u2019s ISSM.  The Contractor will suppor t the \nimplementation of security controls for the system.  The Contractor will  \nparticipate in CCB and other meetings to coordinate for implementation of  \nsecurity controls.  Security control requirements will be documented as a trouble  \nreport for tracking o f implementation.  These will be prioritized by the CCB.  The  \nDISA SRG/STIG Collection Tool will be used to document applicable  \ndocuments.  In addition, each control will be documented with the applicable  \ntrouble report identifier in eMASS.   "

To minimize the software maintenance burden associated with man aging two  \nseparate AFATDS 7.0 variants, the Government intends to implement AFATDS  \n7.0 as a web application(s) for use both on the Web and Smart Clients.  Should the Contractor find that there is a significant challenge in supporting AFATDS 7.0 as a web ap plication(s) when running on a Smart Client, these concerns will be  \npresented to the Government so alternatives can be discussed and selected . \n\nb. In addition to HTML5 web applications, MCE also allows for application \ndevelopers to implement applications as native Android based applications.  \nDevelopment of AFATDS 7.0 as a native Android application(s) is not a preferred implementation method given portability challenges that may exist with this  \napproach.  \n\nc. If the Contractor finds that circumstances favor impl ementation of all or portions  \nof AFATDS 7.0 as a native Android application(s), these factors will be brought  \nto the attention of the Government for discussion and final decision.  \n\n6.2.6 Subtask 6  Legacy Code Review and Removal  \n\nWith utilization of common  services available from COE being a major emphasis  \narea for AFATDS 7.0, it is expected that certain capabilities within AFATDS may  \nbecome duplicative with COE derived functionality.  Organic functionality that is  \nredundant with capability provided via COE  will be removed from AFATDS 7.0.  \n\n6.2.7 Subtask 7  Data Distribution Service (DDS) Suppor t "

        " a. As the DoD transitions from host based security compliance assessments  \nto the utilization of enterprise tools, organizational processes and \nworkflows will be required to adapt a new methodology in support of  \ncontinuous monitoring efforts.  Industry standards such as the Security  \nContent Automa tion Protocols (SCAP) and ACAS are evolving in support  \nof the mission to rapidly deploy content to any security compliance tool in a normalized format.  The compliance tool is now becoming a weapon on the information security battlefield.  The Contractor w ill develop a process  \nfor implementation of cybersecurity tools developed by DoD for  \nmonitoring compliance and assessing systems for vulnerability introduced in the development, implementation or maintenance phases of a system.  This suite of tools will be  deployed as the Continuous Monitoring Suite  \n(CMS).  The Contractor will deliver the CMS for use across PM MC  \nSystems .  CDRL A03 1 \n b. ACAS is an integrated software solution that is scalable to an unlimited  \nnumber of locations.  The solution\u2019s tiering ability  will give DoD  \nenhanced enterprise security while being easy to install and manage.  It  \ncan be easily deployed via download to all DoD agencies  \u2013 without the  \nneed to procure and install appliance devices.  The ACAS product suite  \neasily provides the require d automated network vulnerability scanning, \nconfiguration assessment, application vulnerability scanning, device  \nconfiguration assessment, and network discovery it needs.  Further, the  \nproduct suite generates the required reports and data, with a centraliz ed \nconsole, and is SCAP compliant.  The Contractor will include the ACAS  \nsoftware in the CMS.   \n\nc. SCAP provides information awareness based on standardized results from  \nthose tools to accreditors; systems administrators; information system security managers;  and senior civilian and military commanders for  \ndetermining risk to their environment.  The SCAP Validation Program is  \ndesigned to test the ability of products to use the features and functionality  \navailable through SCAP and its component standards.  SCAP  checklists  \nstandardize and enable automation of the linkage between computer  \nsecurity configurations and the  NIST  SP 80 0-53 controls framework.  The  \ncurrent version of SCAP is meant to perform initial measurement and  \ncontinuous monitoring of security sett ings and corresponding SP 800 -53 \ncontrols.  In this way, SCAP contributes to the implementation, \nassessment, and monitoring steps of the DoD RMF.   \n\nDeliverable(s):   \nCDRL A03 1 Continuous Monitoring Suite (D I-MISC-80508B ) \n\n \n6.13 Task 13  Safet y \n HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  43 of 217 \n\n The Contractor will conduct and implement a system safety management and engineering  \nprogram using MI L-STD-882E.

The past performance evaluation team will consider the performance \nquality of relevant recent efforts for the second aspect of the past performance evaluatio n using  \nSection M Table 4, Past Performance Quality Assessment.  Finally, the past performance \nevaluation team will review this past performance information and determine the quality as it applies to performance confidence assessment.  Performance Confiden ce Assessment ratings are \nidentified in Section M, Table 5.  \n\n5.3.1 Specific Content   \nOfferors are required to explain what aspects of the submitted past performance efforts are deemed  \nrelevant to the proposed effort and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate.  This may  \ninclude a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior  \ncontracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk.  Merely having problems does  \nnot automatically equate  to a limited or no confidence rating because the problems encountered may  \nhave been on a more complex program, or an offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the  \nability to overcome the problems encountered.  The offeror is required to clearly demonstra te \nmanagement actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions in terms of  \nimprovements achieved or problems rectified.  Categorize the relevant information into the specific  \ntechnical/management subfactors used to evaluate the prop osal. \n\n5.3.2 Organizational Structure Change History   \nMany companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc.  In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or  \nbetween conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection.  As a result, it is sometimes  \ndifficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this procurement.  To f acilitate this  \nrelevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a \"roadmap\" describing all such changes in the organization of your company.  A pamphlet or other commercial document  \ndescribing such reorganizations may suffice.  As part of this expl anation, show how these  \nchanges impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/confidence assessment.  Since the Government intends to consider past performance  \ninformation provided by other sources as well as that provide d by the offerors, your \"roadmap\"  \nshould be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources . \n 5.4 Questionnaire s \nThe offeror shall provide the Sample Questionnaire Cover Letter and Past Performance  \nQuestionnaire, found at HC1028 -16-R-0005, Section L, Attachments L-2 and L -3 respectively,  \nto each of the customer POCs identified for each of the submitted past performa nce efforts.  In  \norder to expedite the assessment process, the offeror shall complete Sections I, II and III of the  \nPast Performance Questionnaire for the convenience of the POC.  The offeror shall not, however, complete any other section of the Past Perfo rmance Questionnaire.  Once the questionnaires are  \ncompleted by the POCs, the information contained therein shall be considered sensitive and shall  \nnot be released to the offeror.  Early submission of questionnaires is encouraged.

Normally, price reasonableness is established through cost and  \nprice analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.  The Government will determine  \ncompleteness of the offeror's proposal by verifying that all solicitation requirements have been  \npriced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs are presented in a clear and useful format.  The \nGovernment will evaluate offerors' proposed costs for reasonableness, completeness, affordability and realism.   \n\n6.1 General Instructions   \n\n6.1.1 Cost  Reasonableness, Realism, and Completeness   \nThis section is to assist you in submitting cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the  \nreasonableness, completeness, realism, balance, and/or affordability of your proposed cost.  The  \nGovernment will v erify that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly  \ncalculated, and prices are presented in a clear and useful format.  Note that unrealistically low or  \nhigh proposed costs, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for elimina ting a proposal from  \ncompetition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has  \nsubmitted an unrealistic proposal.  Additionally, unbalanced costs pose an unacceptable risk to \nthe Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror\u2019s proposal.  Cost submissions should be  \nsufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness and be adequate enough to support and sustain a DCAA audit.  \n\n6.1.2 Cost/Price Information  \nInformation beyond that required by this instruction shall  not be submitted, unless you consider  \nit essential to document or support your cost/price position.  All information relating to the  \nproposed price, including all required supporting documentation must be included in the section \nof the proposal designated as the Cost/Price Volume.  Under no circumstances shall this  \ninformation and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal . \n\nLabor and overhead rates should include sufficient detail to sustain a DCAA audit (e.g., direct  \nlabor rates, overhead, fring e benefits, General and Administrative Expense (G&A), fee, etc.).   \n The offeror must provide the basis of estimate for all rates with detailed rationale to support the  \nrates.  For indirect rates, the preferred method for providing support detail is throug h the \nsubmission of a Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) or Forward Pricing Rate  \nRecommendation (FPRR).  However, in the absence of a FPRA/FPRR, the Government will  \naccept all rates and factors by year utilized in the development of the Forward Pricing R ate \nProposal and the basis for these rates and factors (e.g., breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data).  If the contractor is not required to maintain forward pricing rates then the Government will  \naccept other methods of validation.  These methods include  approved provisional billing rates, \nother submitted/approved rates, or the submission of proposed rate calculations (including the  \npools & bases) and the basis of all calculations (e.g., breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data).  The offeror shall state if  rates have been provided to the cognizant Administrative Contracting  HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  184 of 217 \n\n Officer /DCAA office for review or negotiation; if rates have not been submitted, explanation is  \nrequired.

        "6.12.5 Subtask 5  A ssess Security Control s \n\nThe Contractor will support Step 4 of RMF, security control assessment.  The  \nContractor will develop a plan to assess the security controls, known as the  \nSecurity Assessment Plan.  An assessment methodology can be found in NIST  \nSpecial Publication 80 0-53A.  The Contractor will assess the security controls in \naccordance with the security assessment plan and DoD assessment procedures.  Assessment procedures are used to verify that a security control has been properly  \nimplemented.  SRG  and STIG compliance results will be documented and used as  \npart of the overall security control assessment.  This assessment process will be  \nconducted any time there are updates or changes made that would impact the assessments.  Assessments will be recor ded.  If no vulnerabilities are found  \nthrough the process of executing the assessment procedures, the security control is  \nrecorded as compliant.  If vulnerabilities are found, the control is recorded as Not  \nCompliant (NC) in the Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M), with sufficient  \nexplanation.  Vulnerability severity values are assigned to all NC controls by the  \nSCA as part of the security control analysis to indicate the severity associated  \nwith the identified vulnerability.  As part of the overall asses sment prior to  \nauthority to operation, the Government will assign an assessment team.  This team  \nwill be responsible for assessing overall compliance, determination of risk level, \nassessing and characterizing the aggregate level of risk to the system, and \npreparing the security assessment report.  The Contractor will support the ISSM  \nand assessment team in performing this assessment.   \n 6.12.6 Subtask 6  Authorize Syste m \n\nThe Contractor will support Step 5 of RMF, authorize system. The Contractor will  \nassist in the authorization process through review of the POA&M with the ISSM.  \nThe POA&M identifies tasks that need to be accomplished to remediate or  \nmitigate vulnerabilitie s, specifies resources required to accomplish the elements  HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  39 of 217 \n\n of the plan, and includes milestones for completing tasks and their scheduled \ncompletion dates.  The Contractors\u2019 assistance in developing the POA&M is vital  \nto ensuring its maintenance throughout  the system life cycle.  Once posted to the \nPOA&M, vulnerabilities will be updated after correction or mitigation actions are  \ncompleted, but not removed.  The associated trouble report will be documented \nand referenced in the POA&M.  The Government will as semble the security  \nauthorization package for submission to the Authorization Official (AO) for  \nreview and final acceptance.  The risk determinations will be submitted to the AO  \nprior to approvals.   \n\n6.12.7 Subtask 7  Monitor Security Control s \n\nThe Contractor wi ll support Step 6 of the RMF, continuous monitoring of security  \ncontrols.  This is accomplished by continuously monitoring the system for  \nsecurit y-relevant events and configuration changes that negatively affect security  \nposture.  The Contractor will use t he continuous monitoring strategy that was  \ndeveloped for the system and documented in the SSP.  Periodic assessment of the  \nquality of security controls implementation against performance indicators, such  \nas:  security incidents; Government exercises; and o perational evaluations will be  \nconducted by the Government, with the assistance of the Contractor.  In addition, the Contractor will conduct internal assessments when system changes are being  \nconsidered, to determine the risk of the changes.  The Contractor  must report any  \nsignificant change in the security posture of the system, and recommended  \nmitigations, immediately to the Government\u2019s ISSM.  The Contractor or  \nGovernment may recommend to the SCA or AO a reassessment of any or all  \nsecurity controls at an y time.  As part of the continuous monitoring process, the  \nContractor will ensure all servers, switches, routers firewalls, and any other  \nequipment used on the network and managed by the Contractor are Information Assurance Vulnerability Assessment (IAVA) compliant.  All network and security devices will be kept current, configurations will be installed to allow the  \nmost secure network possible while allowing for proper operation, and access to (and through) the network devices shall be strictly controlled.  Server operating  \nsystems will be kept up to date and IAVA compliant.  Contractor will assist the  \nGovernment in performing periodic scans and inspections to ensure compliance.  \nThe Government will be provided with the necessary system accounts to view all  \nsystem and device configurations for all sites handling AFATDS data to ensure  \ncompliance with configuration management, DoD, Army best security practices,  \nand the National Security Agency router secure configuration guidelines.  In \naddition, access will b e provided to the security information management system  \nto view any analysis results to coordinate response to security incidents.  The  \nContractor will configure the Government\u2019s Assured Compliance Assessment  \nSolution (ACAS) for each individual system.   \n\n6.12.8 Subtask 8  Security Engineering  \n HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  40 of 217 \n\n a.

The Contractor will assist the  \nGovernment in the selection of appropriate controls by identification of the  \nsecurity con trol baseline for the system, and documenting these in the SSP.  \nBaseline controls and control overlays will be tailored for the system.  Overlays  \nmay add or subtract security controls, or provide additional guidance regarding  \nsecurity controls, resulting i n a set of security controls applicable to the system  \nthat is a combination of the baseline and overlay.  The combination of baselines  \nand overlays address the unique security protection needs associated with the  \nsystem.  If necessary, control sets will b e tailored (modified) in response to  \nincreased risk from changes in threats or vulnerabilities, or variations in risk  \ntolerance.  Tailoring decisions must be coordinated with the Government, and \naligned with operational considerations and the system environ ment.  Security  \ncontrols will be added or removed only as a function of specified, ris k-based  \ndeterminations.  Tailoring decisions, including the specific rationale (e.g., mapping to risk tolerance) for those decisions, will be documented in the security  \nplan for the system.  A monitoring strategy must be developed and documented as  \na syste m-level strategy for the continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of  \nsecurity controls employed within or inherited by the system, and monitoring of  \nany proposed or ac tual changes to the system and its environment of operation.  \nThe strategy must include the plan for annual assessments of a subset of  \nimplemented security controls, and the level of independence required of the  \nassessor (e.g., Information System Security M anager (ISSM) or Security Control  \nAssessor (SCA)).  The breadth, depth, and rigor of these annual assessments will  \nbe reflective of the security categorization of the system and threats to the system.

FAR 9.502 states that \u201can organization COI may result when \nfactors create an ac tual or potential conflict of interest on an instant contract, or when the nature of  \nthe work to be performed on the instant contract creates an actual or potential COI on a future  \nacquisition.\u201d  An organizational COI exists when the nature of the work to b e performed may, without  \nsome restriction on future activities, (1) result in an unfair competitive advantage to the contractor on \nother contracts or (2) impair the contractor\u2019s objectivity in performing the contract work.  The  \nprimary burden is on the con tractor to identify any organizational COI, however, the Government has  \nthe responsibility to identify and evaluate such conflicts.   \n\nc. Identification of No n-Disclosure Requirements .  Contractor personnel working under this contract with  \naccess to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) or Secret information shall be required to sign  \nNon-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs).  All NDAs shall be maintained by the Contractor and submitted  \nto the COR prior to accessing any CUI or Secret data.     "

The offeror's proposed estimated costs shall  not be \ncontrolling for source selection purposes.  PC shall be measured as follows:   \n - Government estimate of anticipated performance costs and proposed fee . \n - Government estimate of anticipated performance costs plus any fee to be earned \nunder the cost incentive . \n - Government estimate of anticipated performance costs plus any base fee proposed \nplus any fee anticipated to be awarded.  (See FAR 15.404 -1(d))   \n   (2) Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such \noptions.     (3) The offeror\u2019s cost proposal will be evaluated, using one or more of the  \ntechniques defined in FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is reasonable, realisti c, and \ncomplete.  For additional information see FAR 31.201 -3. \n   (4) The Government will evaluate the realism of each offeror\u2019s proposed costs.  \nThis will include an evaluation of the extent to which proposed costs are sufficient for the work \nto be perfor med, reflective of a clear understanding of the requirements, and consistent with the  \nunique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror\u2019s technical/management  \nproposal (FAR 15.404- 1(d)(1) and 2.101).   \n   \n  (5)  In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation factors other than \ncost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.   \n\nM003  SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS  \n Offerors are required to meet all solicitatio n requirements, such as terms and conditions, \nrepresentations and certifications, and technical/management requirements, in addition to those  \nidentified as factors or subfactors.  Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the  \nsolicitation may res ult in the offeror being ineligible for award.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n ",
        " b. Evaluatio n \n   \nThe technical proposal should include all information the offeror wants the Government to \nconsider and evaluate regarding its compan y\u2019s ability to perform all required tasks and conform  \nto all required terms and conditions.  The best value determination will be based on the stated \nevaluation factors.   \n The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussion s with  \nofferors.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions or seek \nclarifications if the contracting officer determines they are necessary.  In the event issues  \npertaining to a proposed contract cannot be resolved to the contracti ng officer\u2019s satisfaction, the \nGovernment reserves the right to withdraw and cancel the  solicitation.  In such event, offerors  \nwill be notified in writing.  In the event a competitive range is established and the contracting  \nofficer determines that the nu mber of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range  \nexceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the contracting officer  \nmay limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will \npermit an efficient competition . \n\n c. Evaluation of Option s  \n  \nThe Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options  \nto the total price for the base period.  The offeror shall submit pricing for the base period and a ll \noption periods, including option pricing for an additional si x-month extension period that may be  HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  207 of 217 \n\n authorized in accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.217 -8.  See FAR 52.217 -8 which authorizes the  \nGovernment to require continued performance of any services withi n the limits and at the rates  \nspecified in the contract.  The pricing proposal should include a separate line item for the  \nadditional si x-month extension period IAW FAR 52.217 -8. The pricing for the additional si x-\nmonth extension period, IAW FAR 52.217 -8, applies to the Engineering Support Services and \nODC CLINs only. These prices shall be identical to the proposed pricing in the six months prior  \nto expiration of the base period, or the final option period, if option periods are present.  The  \ntotal evaluate d price will consist of the contractor\u2019s proposed price for the base period, all option \nperiods, and the option pricing for the additional si x-month extension period.  The Government  \nmay determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are sign ificantly unbalanced.  \nEvaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.   \n\n d. Number of Contracts to be Awarde d \n\nThe Government intends to award one contract for the AFATDS 7.0 Modernization Program;  \nhowever, the Government  reserves the right to make no award at all . \n\n e. Rejection of Offers   \n\nThe Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program  \ncommitments, contract terms and conditions.  Additionally, the Government may reject  \nproposals that are unrealistically high or low in cost when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program . \n  \nM002 EVALUATION FA CTOR S \n\na.

        " b. Past performance information is relevant information regarding the contractor\u2019s actions  \nunder previously awarded contracts.  The written performance evaluation will state  \nwhether the service s/supplies met the Government\u2019s stated requirements and  \nspecifications and if they were performed/delivered on time.  It includes, for example, the  \ncontractor\u2019s record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good \nworkmanship; the contra ctor\u2019s adherence to contract schedules, including the  \nadministrative aspects of performance; the contractor\u2019s history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the  \ncontractor\u2019s busines s-like concern for t he interest of the customer.  This evaluation may  \nbe either printed or electronic format, as defined by the Government . \n\nc. The evaluation of the contractor\u2019s performance will be used as a criterion for  \nexercising any unexercised option.  The evaluation will  also be used by DISA and \nother Government agencies as source selection information to support future  \nGovernment procurements . \n\nH.5 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI)/OCI MITIGATION PLA N \n\na. An organizational conflict of interest means that because of othe r activities or  \nrelationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render  \nimpartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a perso n has an  \nunfair competitive advantage.  The Government seeks to acquire unbiased advi ce \nand/or goods and services from offerors/contractors that are free from, or have  \nmitigated, Organizational Conflicts of Interest , as defined in FAR 2.101, relating to this contract . \n\nb. In order for the Government to try to prevent an OCI relating to this contract, the  \nparties  to this contract agree that the contractor\u2019s future contracting with the  \nGovernment may be restricted as outlined in FAR Subpart 9.5, if the  \nofferor/ contractor and DISA are unable to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate actual or  \npotential OCI before contract award . \n\nc. DISA will not automatically exclude a vendor from a competitive acquisition due to  \nan actual or potential OCI.  The Contracting Office is comm itted to working with  \npotential vendors to eliminate or mitigate actual and potential OCI situations, without detriment to the integrity of the competitive process, the DISA mission, or the  \nlegitimate business interests of the vendor community . \n\nd. If the off eror or contractor is aware, or should have been aware, of an OCI before  \naward of this contract or any task under against the contract, and does not fully  \ndisclose that conflict to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the  \ncontractor for de fault. \n HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  69 of 217 \n\n e. The offeror or contractor, by submitting an offer and/or signing the contract, warrants  \nthat it is  not now aware of any actual or potential OCI relating to this contract . \n\nf. After contract award, the contractor shall have an ongoing obligation to make  \u201ca \nprompt and full disclosure\u201d to the Contracting Officer of any OCI that arises during  \nthe performance of the contract, as well as newly discovered conflicts that existed  \nbefore contract award . \n\ng. The OCI Mitigation Plan shall become part of the resultant contract and the  \ncontractor shall update its OCI Mitigation Plan within 30 days of any changes to the  \nlegal construct of the organization, subcontractor changes, or significant management  \nor ownership changes that would result in an actual or potential OC I under this  \ncontract .

Organizational COI is a situation where  \nbecause of other relationships or activities a person (company)  is unable or potentially unable to \nrender impartial assistance or advice to the Government or cannot objectively perform contract work  \nor has an unfair competitive advantage.  FAR 9.502 states that \u201can organization COI may result when \nfactors create an ac tual or potential conflict of interest on an instant contract, or when the nature of  \nthe work to be performed on the instant contract creates an actual or potential COI on a future  \nacquisition.\u201d  An organizational COI exists when the nature of the work to b e performed may, without  \nsome restriction on future activities, (1) result in an unfair competitive advantage to the contractor on \nother contracts or (2) impair the contractor\u2019s objectivity in performing the contract work.  The  \nprimary burden is on the con tractor to identify any organizational COI, however, the Government has  \nthe responsibility to identify and evaluate such conflicts.   \n\nc. Identification of No n-Disclosure Requirements .  Contractor personnel working under this contract with  \naccess to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) or Secret information shall be required to sign  \nNon-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs).  All NDAs shall be maintained by the Contractor and submitted  \nto the COR prior to accessing any CUI or Secret data.     "
