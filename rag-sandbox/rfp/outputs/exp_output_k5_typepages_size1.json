PROJECT INFORMATION  \n \n1.1   ABOUT INCOURAGE  \nEstablished in 1994, Incourage Community Foundation is a nationally recognized leader in place -based \nphilanthropy and community change efforts.  Incourage operates with a vision of a community that works well for \nall people. To achieve this vision, values of equity, inclusion and opportunity are applied to all work, and to the \nrelationships Incourage fosters to accomplish its work. To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and \nsubcontractors who:  \n \n\uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius;  \n\uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work;  \n\uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work;  \n\uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place;  \n\uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to \ncorporate social responsibility.  \n \nIncourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement  services under an AIA A133 contract \nstructure with  a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this  \nRFP (the  \u201cProject\u201d  and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) . The selected Proposer will become the \nConstruction Manager  (CM).  \n \n1.2 DELIVERY METHOD  \nThe delivery method for the Project is \u201c Construction Manager  at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133 \nbased contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase.    \n \n1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND  \nThe Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the \nhistoric Tribune Building  along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To \ndate, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making \nprocess.  As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new \neconomy and co mmunity that works well for all.  \n",
        "Page 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n \n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n \nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n \n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.  \n \n\uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \n \n\uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C.  \n \nAll Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP.  \n \n1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American \nInstitute of Architects)  \nConstruction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction \nManager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n \n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2. The Owner and Construction Manager  \nmay agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of \nthe Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall \nidentify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project.   ",

The Construction Manager  shall advise the Owner and the \nArchitect on proposed site use and improvements , selection of materials, and building systems and equipment. \nThe Construction Manager  shall also provide recommendations consistent with the Pro ject requirements to the \nOwner and Architect on constructability; availability of materials and labor; time requirements for procurement, \ninstallation and construction; and factors related to construction cos t including, but not limited to:  costs of \naltern ative designs or materials, preliminary budgets, life -cycle data, and possible cost reductions.  \n \nThe Construction Manager  shall provide recommendations with regard to accelerated or fast -track scheduling, \nprocurement, or phased construction. The Construction Manager  shall take into consideration cost reductions, \ncost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction \nscheduling issues.   \n \nPreliminary  Cost  Estimates  \nBased on the preliminary design and  other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate  of Probable \nCost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager  suggests alternative materials and systems, the \nConstruction Manager  shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems.  \n \nAs the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design  Documents, the Construction Manager  shall \nprepare  estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further \ndevelopment of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager  agree on a Guaranteed \nMaximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s \napproval  prior to the completion of each phase . The Construction Manage r shall inform the Owner and Architect \nwhen estimates of the Cost of the Work exceed the latest approved Project budget and make recommendations \nfor corrective action.   \n \nGuaranteed  Maximum  Price  Proposal  and Contract  Time  \nAt a time to be mutually agreed up on by the Owner and the Construction Manager  and in consultation with the \nArchitect, the Construction Manager  shall prepare a detailed line item  Guaranteed Maximum Price Proposal for \nthe Owner\u2019s review and acceptance.  The Guaranteed Maximum Price in the pr oposal shall be the sum of the \nConstruction Manager \u2019s estimate of the Cost of the Work and the Construction Manager \u2019s Fee for the \nConstruction Phase as quoted in the Proposer\u2019s response to this RFP.  \n \nThe Construction Manager  shall include with the Guarant eed Maximum Price proposal a written statement of its \nbasis, which shall include the following:  \n 1. A list of the Drawings and Specifications, including all Addenda thereto, and the Conditions of the \nContract;  \n 2. A list of the clarifications and assumptions made by the Construction Manager  in the preparation of \nthe Guaranteed Maximum Price proposal,  \n 3. A statement of the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price, including a statement of the estimated \nCost of the Work organized by trade categories or systems, allowances, contingency, and the \nConstruction Manager \u2019s Fee;  \n 4. A schedule of milestones for the comple tion and the anticipated date of Substantial Completion upon \nwhich the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price is based;  \n 5. A Schedule of Value for each component of work to be undertaken; and \n 6. A date by which the Owner must accept the Guaranteed Maximum Pr ice.  \n \nThe Construction Manager  shall meet with the Owner and Architect to review the Guaranteed Maximum Price \nproposal.  Once a Guaranteed Maximum Price has been agreed upon by all parties, the Owner and Construction \nManager  shall execute the Guaranteed M aximum Price Amendment to the Contract.  The Guaranteed Maximum ",

To the extent \nthe Cost of the Work exceeds the Guaranteed Maximum Price, t he Construction Manager  shall bear such costs in \nexcess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price without reimbursement or additional compensation from the Owner.   \nThe Construction Manager will acknowledge that the Construction Manager is an experienced contractor a nd \nthat (subject to Acts of God) the Project can be completed for Guaranteed Maximum Price.  \n \nSubcontractors  and Suppliers  \nThose portions of the Work that the Construction Manager  does not customarily perform with the Construction \nManager \u2019s own personnel s hall be performed under subcontracts or by other appropriate agreements with the \nConstruction Manager . The Owner may designate specific persons from whom, or entities from which, the \nConstruction Manager  shall obtain bids. Subcontractors must be located 50 miles  or less from the Project site , \nunless a greater distance is approved by the Owner.  The Construction Manager  shall obtain at least three \nproposals from Subcontractors and from suppliers of materials or equipment fabricated especially for the Work \nand shall deliver suc h proposals  to the Owner. The Owner shall then determine, with the advice of the \nConstruction Manager  and the Architect, which bids will be accepted.

The Architect  shall issue such changes in writing  \nand all change orders will be signed and acknowledged by Owner and Construction Manager . The Constru ction \nManager  shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the Contract Time as a result of changes in the Work.  \n \nChange orders issued by the Owner subsequent to the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment \nshall constitute adjustments to the  Guaranteed Maximum Price.  \n \nAdministration  \nUpon the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment, the Construction Manager  shall prepare and \nsubmit to the Owner and Architect a construction schedule for the Work.  The Construction Manager  shall \nupdate the Owner in writing on the progress of the Project on a monthly basis indicating the percentages of \ncompletion and other information required by the Owner.  \n \nThe Construction Manager  shall develop a system of cost control for the Work, inclu ding regular monitoring of \nactual costs for activities in progress (compared to the Schedule of Values) and estimates for uncompleted tasks \nand proposed changes.

        "Page 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n \n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n \nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n \n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.  \n \n\uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \n \n\uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C.  \n \nAll Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP.  \n \n1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American \nInstitute of Architects)  \nConstruction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction \nManager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n \n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2. The Owner and Construction Manager  \nmay agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of \nthe Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall \nidentify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project.   ",

        "Page 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n \n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n \nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n \n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.  \n \n\uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \n \n\uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C.  \n \nAll Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP.  \n \n1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American \nInstitute of Architects)  \nConstruction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction \nManager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n \n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2. The Owner and Construction Manager  \nmay agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of \nthe Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall \nidentify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project.   ",

Incourage \nCommunity Foundation  reserves the right to accept or reject any or all proposals received as a result of this \nrequest, to negotiate with all qualified Propose rs or to cancel this Request for Proposals, if it is in the best \ninterests of Incourage Community Foundation to do so.  \n \nAfter the selection of a C onstruction Manager,  the schedule should include a period of collaboration between \nIncourage Community Founda tion and the C onstruction Manager  to better define, elaborate upon and fix the \nConstruction Manager \u2019s exact and final scope of Work (the \u201cFinal Scope\u201d) . \n \nThe successful Proposer  should be available to begin work, and should be prepared for project activities to \ncommenc e, immediately upon selection. Please refer to Exhibit C \u2013 Project Timeline.  Your submission of a \nproposal  to this RFP acknowledges your ability to work within this timeline  but also acknowledges that there may \nbe adjustments to the timeline as the Project evolves . Proposers are  asked to carefully review and note all \nconstruction start dates, completion dates, and other notable objectives outlined in the attached t imeline.    \n \nPlease note: non -selection as the Construction Manager under this RFP does not impact the Proposer\u2019s \nopportunity to participate in the Project as a sub -contractor.    \n \n9.

Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n \n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n \nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n \n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.  \n \n\uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \n \n\uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C.  \n \nAll Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP.  \n \n1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American \nInstitute of Architects)  \nConstruction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction \nManager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n \n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2. The Owner and Construction Manager  \nmay agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of \nthe Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall \nidentify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project.   "

Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n \n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n \nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n \n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.  \n \n\uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \n \n\uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C.  \n \nAll Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP.  \n \n1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American \nInstitute of Architects)  \nConstruction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction \nManager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract.

        "Page 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n \n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n \nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n \n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.  \n \n\uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \n \n\uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C.  \n \nAll Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP.  \n \n1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American \nInstitute of Architects)  \nConstruction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction \nManager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n \n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2. The Owner and Construction Manager  \nmay agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of \nthe Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall \nidentify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project.   "

        "Page 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n \n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.

Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n \n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n \nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n \n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.  \n \n\uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \n \n\uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C.  \n \nAll Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP.  \n \n1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American \nInstitute of Architects)  \nConstruction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction \nManager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n \n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2. The Owner and Construction Manager  \nmay agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of \nthe Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall \nidentify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project.   "

Termination for Default    \n \nIn case of default by a contractor for failure to deliver or perform in accordance with the contract \nspecifications or terms and conditions, the County  may procure the articles or services from other sources and \nhold the defaulting contractor responsible for any resulting additional purchase and administrative costs.  The \nCounty will normally repurchase from the next low bidder or purchase competitively by resolicitation.

Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n \n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n \nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n \n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.  \n \n\uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \n \n\uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C.  \n \nAll Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP.  \n \n1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American \nInstitute of Architects)  \nConstruction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction \nManager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n \n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2. The Owner and Construction Manager  \nmay agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of \nthe Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall \nidentify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project.   ",

PROJECT INFORMATION  \n \n1.1   ABOUT INCOURAGE  \nEstablished in 1994, Incourage Community Foundation is a nationally recognized leader in place -based \nphilanthropy and community change efforts.  Incourage operates with a vision of a community that works well for \nall people. To achieve this vision, values of equity, inclusion and opportunity are applied to all work, and to the \nrelationships Incourage fosters to accomplish its work. To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and \nsubcontractors who:  \n \n\uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius;  \n\uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work;  \n\uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work;  \n\uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place;  \n\uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to \ncorporate social responsibility.  \n \nIncourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement  services under an AIA A133 contract \nstructure with  a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this  \nRFP (the  \u201cProject\u201d  and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) . The selected Proposer will become the \nConstruction Manager  (CM).  \n \n1.2 DELIVERY METHOD  \nThe delivery method for the Project is \u201c Construction Manager  at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133 \nbased contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase.    \n \n1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND  \nThe Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the \nhistoric Tribune Building  along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To \ndate, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making \nprocess.  As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new \neconomy and co mmunity that works well for all.  \n",
        "Page 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n \n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n \nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n \n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.  \n \n\uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \n \n\uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C.  \n \nAll Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP.  \n \n1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American \nInstitute of Architects)  \nConstruction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction \nManager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n \n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2.

Freight charges are, therefore, established for each indi vidual purchase.  If a requirement is bid \nF.O.B. origin, the contractor shall prepay the charges and add the amount to the invoice.  A copy of the \nfreight bill should be attached to all invoices that include freight charges.  In a solicitation specifying F .O.B. \norigin the state will consider freight cost in the evaluation of bids.  \n \n16.   Termination for Default    \n \nIn case of default by a contractor for failure to deliver or perform in accordance with the contract \nspecifications or terms and conditions, the County  may procure the articles or services from other sources and \nhold the defaulting contractor responsible for any resulting additional purchase and administrative costs.  The \nCounty will normally repurchase from the next low bidder or purchase competitively by resolicitation.

When repayment is requested, the contractor will be removed from future \nbidding until the repayment has occurred.  Contractors shall not be liable for any excess cost if the failure to \nperform arises out of any act of war, order of legal authority, strikes, act of God, or other unavoidable causes ",

The contractor is \neligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool at each Gate if the engineering release is delivered to the \nGovernment with n o Priority 1 or 2 errors; no exceptions.  Priority levels are as define d in the AFATDS  \nSRS.  There is no limit on Priority 3 or 4 error rates.  The data used to substantiate this performance  \nassessment will be the contractor\u2019s testing data supplied in the applicable CDRL  A035 \u2013 Software Test  \nDescription.   \n \n Gates 1, 2, and 3 Successively Superior Flat Fee  \nThe contractor is eligible to earn 20% of the available 5% fee pool as a flat fee bonus for successively  \nmeeting Gates 1, 2, and 3, as defined above.  Therefore, if the contractor delivers  all thre e engineering  \nreleases (engineering releases 3, 6, and 9) with  no Priority 1 or 2 errors, they are eligible for the flat fee  \nbonus; no exceptions.  \n \nAs stated under Gates 1, 2, and 3, the priority levels are as defined in the AFATDS SRS.

Security control requirements will be documented as a trouble  \nreport for tracking o f implementation.  These will be prioritized by the CCB.  The  \nDISA SRG/STIG Collection Tool will be used to document applicable  \ndocuments.

The  \nContractor will develop a plan to assess the security controls, known as the  \nSecurity Assessment Plan.  An assessment methodology can be found in NIST  \nSpecial Publication 80 0-53A.  The Contractor will assess the security controls in \naccordance with the security assessment plan and DoD assessment procedures.  Assessment procedures are used to verify that a security control has been properly  \nimplemented.  SRG  and STIG compliance results will be documented and used as  \npart of the overall security control assessment.  This assessment process will be  \nconducted any time there are updates or changes made that would impact the assessments.  Assessments will be recor ded.  If no vulnerabilities are found  \nthrough the process of executing the assessment procedures, the security control is  \nrecorded as compliant.  If vulnerabilities are found, the control is recorded as Not  \nCompliant (NC) in the Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M), with sufficient  \nexplanation.  Vulnerability severity values are assigned to all NC controls by the  \nSCA as part of the security control analysis to indicate the severity associated  \nwith the identified vulnerability.  As part of the overall asses sment prior to  \nauthority to operation, the Government will assign an assessment team.  This team  \nwill be responsible for assessing overall compliance, determination of risk level, \nassessing and characterizing the aggregate level of risk to the system, and \npreparing the security assessment report.  The Contractor will support the ISSM  \nand assessment team in performing this assessment.   \n 6.12.6 Subtask 6  Authorize Syste m \n \nThe Contractor will support Step 5 of RMF, authorize system.

Normally, price reasonableness is established through cost and  \nprice analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.  The Government will determine  \ncompleteness of the offeror's proposal by verifying that all solicitation requirements have been  \npriced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs are presented in a clear and useful format.  The \nGovernment will evaluate offerors' proposed costs for reasonableness, completeness, affordability and realism.   \n \n6.1 General Instructions   \n \n6.1.1 Cost  Reasonableness, Realism, and Completeness   \nThis section is to assist you in submitting cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the  \nreasonableness, completeness, realism, balance, and/or affordability of your proposed cost.  The  \nGovernment will v erify that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly  \ncalculated, and prices are presented in a clear and useful format.  Note that unrealistically low or  \nhigh proposed costs, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for elimina ting a proposal from  \ncompetition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has  \nsubmitted an unrealistic proposal.  Additionally, unbalanced costs pose an unacceptable risk to \nthe Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror\u2019s proposal.  Cost submissions should be  \nsufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness and be adequate enough to support and sustain a DCAA audit.  \n \n6.1.2 Cost/Price Information  \nInformation beyond that required by this instruction shall  not be submitted, unless you consider  \nit essential to document or support your cost/price position.  All information relating to the  \nproposed price, including all required supporting documentation must be included in the section \nof the proposal designated as the Cost/Price Volume.  Under no circumstances shall this  \ninformation and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal . \n \nLabor and overhead rates should include sufficient detail to sustain a DCAA audit (e.g., direct  \nlabor rates, overhead, fring e benefits, General and Administrative Expense (G&A), fee, etc.).   \n The offeror must provide the basis of estimate for all rates with detailed rationale to support the  \nrates.  For indirect rates, the preferred method for providing support detail is throug h the \nsubmission of a Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) or Forward Pricing Rate  \nRecommendation (FPRR).  However, in the absence of a FPRA/FPRR, the Government will  \naccept all rates and factors by year utilized in the development of the Forward Pricing R ate \nProposal and the basis for these rates and factors (e.g., breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data).  If the contractor is not required to maintain forward pricing rates then the Government will  \naccept other methods of validation.  These methods include  approved provisional billing rates, \nother submitted/approved rates, or the submission of proposed rate calculations (including the  \npools & bases) and the basis of all calculations (e.g., breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data).

The past performance evaluation team will consider the performance \nquality of relevant recent efforts for the second aspect of the past performance evaluatio n using  \nSection M Table 4, Past Performance Quality Assessment.  Finally, the past performance \nevaluation team will review this past performance information and determine the quality as it applies to performance confidence assessment.  Performance Confiden ce Assessment ratings are \nidentified in Section M, Table 5.  \n \n5.3.1 Specific Content   \nOfferors are required to explain what aspects of the submitted past performance efforts are deemed  \nrelevant to the proposed effort and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate.  This may  \ninclude a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior  \ncontracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk.  Merely having problems does  \nnot automatically equate  to a limited or no confidence rating because the problems encountered may  \nhave been on a more complex program, or an offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the  \nability to overcome the problems encountered.  The offeror is required to clearly demonstra te \nmanagement actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions in terms of  \nimprovements achieved or problems rectified.  Categorize the relevant information into the specific  \ntechnical/management subfactors used to evaluate the prop osal. \n \n5.3.2 Organizational Structure Change History   \nMany companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc.  In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or  \nbetween conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection.  As a result, it is sometimes  \ndifficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this procurement.  To f acilitate this  \nrelevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a \"roadmap\" describing all such changes in the organization of your company.  A pamphlet or other commercial document  \ndescribing such reorganizations may suffice.  As part of this expl anation, show how these  \nchanges impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/confidence assessment.  Since the Government intends to consider past performance  \ninformation provided by other sources as well as that provide d by the offerors, your \"roadmap\"  \nshould be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources . \n 5.4 Questionnaire s \nThe offeror shall provide the Sample Questionnaire Cover Letter and Past Performance  \nQuestionnaire, found at HC1028 -16-R-0005, Section L, Attachments L-2 and L -3 respectively,  \nto each of the customer POCs identified for each of the submitted past performa nce efforts.  In  \norder to expedite the assessment process, the offeror shall complete Sections I, II and III of the  \nPast Performance Questionnaire for the convenience of the POC.  The offeror shall not, however, complete any other section of the Past Perfo rmance Questionnaire.  Once the questionnaires are  \ncompleted by the POCs, the information contained therein shall be considered sensitive and shall  \nnot be released to the offeror.  Early submission of questionnaires is encouraged.  Questionnaires  \nshall be s ent directly to DITCO at  karen.m.kinzel2.civ@mail.mi l and \ndustie.m.thompson.civ@mail.mi l, no later than the due date stated in the RFP.    ",

The Government seeks to acquire unbiased advi ce \nand/or goods and services from offerors/contractors that are free from, or have  \nmitigated, Organizational Conflicts of Interest , as defined in FAR 2.101, relating to this contract . \n \nb. In order for the Government to try to prevent an OCI relating to this contract, the  \nparties  to this contract agree that the contractor\u2019s future contracting with the  \nGovernment may be restricted as outlined in FAR Subpart 9.5, if the  \nofferor/ contractor and DISA are unable to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate actual or  \npotential OCI before contract award . \n \nc. DISA will not automatically exclude a vendor from a competitive acquisition due to  \nan actual or potential OCI.  The Contracting Office is comm itted to working with  \npotential vendors to eliminate or mitigate actual and potential OCI situations, without detriment to the integrity of the competitive process, the DISA mission, or the  \nlegitimate business interests of the vendor community . \n \nd. If the off eror or contractor is aware, or should have been aware, of an OCI before  \naward of this contract or any task under against the contract, and does not fully  \ndisclose that conflict to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the  \ncontractor for de fault. \n ",

After contract award, the contractor shall have an ongoing obligation to make  \u201ca \nprompt and full disclosure\u201d to the Contracting Officer of any OCI that arises during  \nthe performance of the contract, as well as newly discovered conflicts that existed  \nbefore contract award . \n \ng. The OCI Mitigation Plan shall become part of the resultant contract and the  \ncontractor shall update its OCI Mitigation Plan within 30 days of any changes to the  \nlegal construct of the organization, subcontractor changes, or significant management  \nor ownership changes that would result in an actual or potential OC I under this  \ncontract . \n \nH.6 52.237- 9001 Enterpris e-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application  \n(eCMRA) Reporting.   \n \nENTERPRIS E-WIDE CONTRACTOR MANPOWER REPORTING APPLICATION (eCMRA)  \nREPORTING (JAN 2015 ) \n The contractor shall ensure ALL contractor labor hours including subcontractor, at all  \nlevels/tiers, labor hours required for the performance of services provided under this contract are  \nreported via a secure data collection site.   \n The contractor and all  subcontractors, at all levels/tiers, providing direct labor under this contract  \nshall report complete and accurate data for the labor executed during the period of performance during each Government fiscal year (FY), which runs from October 1 to September  30.

Recent contracts are considered to be efforts that the prime offeror and its teaming partners, joint  \nventure or s ignificant subcontractors have performed within the past five years prior to original  \nissuance of the solicitation, or for ongoing efforts the period of performance of which must have  \nstarted at least nine months before the original proposal due date.

The 2% fee allocated to this  \nincentive is based upon the agreed upon target cost and  does no t increase/decrease if  the contractor  \nrealizes a Target Cost Underrun/Overrun.

The contractor will then invoice  \nthis set amount o f fee in each invoice as long as their EAC remains under or equal to the agreed upon \ntarget cost.      \n \n7.2 Incentive #2:  Performance ( 0-5% Gateway Incentive ) \nThe contractor is eligible to earn up to 5% fee for delivering an AFATDS 7.0 baseline that opera tionally  \ndemonstrates it meets all baseline requirements as outlined in the AFATDS Software Requirements \nSpecification (SRS) by the end of the CLIN 0001 PoP.  The 5% fee allocated to this incentive is based \nupon the agreed upon target cost and does no t increase/decrease if the contractor realizes a target cost  \nunderrun/overrun.  The fee available for this incentive  will be set at time of awar d based upon the agreed \nupon target cost and available target fee.   \n \nThis incentive is a  Gateway Fee incentive that b uilds off of initial and continued superior performanc e.  \nThe Government will assess performance at defined \u201cGates\u201d (as described below).  If the contractor  \nsuccessfully meets the performance parameters at each Gate, they earn fee.  In addition, if the con tractor  \nsequentiall y meets the performance parameters of Gates 1, 2, and 3, they are eligible to earn a flat fee \nbonus.  If the contractor does not successively pass Gates 1, 2, and 3 they forfeit their opportunity to  \nearn the flat fee bonu s.  Forfeiting t he flat fee bonus for not successively passing Gates 1, 2, and 3  does \nnot impact the contractor\u2019s ability to earn fee at the Final Gate.   \n \nIn alignment with the Statement of Objectives, paragraph, 6.15, the contractor is to deliver engineer  \nreleases starti ng 120 calendar days after contract award and every 60 days thereafter.  It is anticipated  \nthere will be a total of 10 engineering releases and 1 final release throughout the PoP of CLIN 0001.  \n Therefore, the defined Gates for this incentive will focus on a subset of those engineering releases and are \nas stated below:   \nGate 1  - Engineering Release 3   \nGate 2  - Engineering Release 6   \nGate 3  - Engineering Release 9   \nFinal Gate  - AFATDS 7.0 Baseline Release  \n \n Gate 1 (Engineering Release 3), Gate 2 (Engineering Release 6), and Gate 3 (Engineering  \nRelease 9)   \nThe contractor is eligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool for engineering releases 3, 6, and 9  \n(for a total of 30% of the available 5% fee pool i f each gate is achieved successfully).  The contractor is \neligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool at each Gate if the engineering release is delivered to the \nGovernment with n o Priority 1 or 2 errors; no exceptions.  Priority levels are as define d in the AFATDS  \nSRS.  There is no limit on Priority 3 or 4 error rates.  The data used to substantiate this performance  \nassessment will be the contractor\u2019s testing data supplied in the applicable CDRL  A035 \u2013 Software Test  \nDescription.   \n \n Gates 1, 2, and 3 Successively Superior Flat Fee  \nThe contractor is eligible to earn 20% of the available 5% fee pool as a flat fee bonus for successively  \nmeeting Gates 1, 2, and 3, as defined above.  Therefore, if the contractor delivers  all thre e engineering  \nreleases (engineering releases 3, 6, and 9) with  no Priority 1 or 2 errors, they are eligible for the flat fee  \nbonus; no exceptions.  \n \nAs stated under Gates 1, 2, and 3, the priority levels are as defined in the AFATDS SRS.

Therefore, this plan will be updated as needed throughout  \nthe cont ract Period of Performance (PoP) in order to ensure it continues to effectively incentivize superior  \nperformance and result in a sound business arrangement between all parties.  Any changes to this plan  \nafter contract award will be mutually agreed upon be tween the Government and contractor.   \n \n6.  Incentive Fee Allocatio n.  This Incentives Plan is currently structured to incentivize contractor  \nperformance under the AFATDS Modernization and Development Baseline (CLIN 0001).  The incentives  \nfor AFATDS  Modernization and Development Target (CLIN 0002 ), will be subject to mutual agreement  \nprior to exercising that option with the exceptio n of the Cost Control Incentive.  \n \nAt time of award, the contractor\u2019s target cost and target fee will be agreed upon for  CLIN 0001, the  \ncontractor will be eligible to earn up to 15% fee/bonus pool on the target cost of CLIN 0001.  With the  \nexception of the provision fee listed in paragraph 7.1 for Incentive #1, the Government will perform an \nincentive review prior to paymen t of any fees.  In incentive #2, the Government will review and make a \nfinal determination for the fee earned in performance of engineering releases and provide the results to the  \ncontracting officer.  The contractor will then be notified of the approval t o invoice against the incentive  \nCLIN . \n 7.  Incentives .  This contract will utilize a multiple incentive approach.  Below are the incentives the  \ncontractor is eligible to earn during the PoP of CLIN 0001.  All percentages will be rounded to the nearest  \ntenth. \n \n7.1 Incentive #1:  Cost Control ( 0-5% Incentive)  \nThe Government will assess contractor cost control.  At time of award, a target cost for CLIN 0001, based  \nupon the contractor\u2019s proposal, will be finalized and documented in Section B of the contract.  T he \nfollowing calculation(s) will be utilized to determine fee on cost control performance as related to the  \ntarget cost of CLIN 0001.  \n  \nTarget Cost   \n The contractor will be eligible for 2% fee for meeting target cost.  Below is the formula to be \nutilized : \n \n \n*The above table is an example to show calculation/formula, amounts are subject to the agreed upon \ntarget cost.  \n   \nCost Underru n \nAgreed Upon Target Cost   \n 100.00  \n $                 \n   \n a \nActual Cos t \n 100.00  \n $                 \n   \n b \nUnderrun/Overru n \n - \n $                        \n  \n a - b = 0  \nFee \n 2.00 \n $                      \n   \n b * .02 = c  \nFull Contract Obligatio n \n 102.00  \n $                 \n   \n b + c = d  \nFee  \n 2.0%  \n c / b = fee  \nTarget Cost Calculatio n "
