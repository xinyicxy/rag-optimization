PROJECT INFORMATION 1.1 ABOUT INCOURAGE Established in 1994, Incourage Community Foundation is a nationally recognized leader in place -based philanthropy and community change efforts. Incourage operates with a vision of a community that works well for all people. To achieve this vision, values of equity, inclusion and opportunity are applied to all work, and to the relationships Incourage fosters to accomplish its work. To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and subcontractors who: \uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius; \uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work; \uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work; \uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place; \uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to corporate social responsibility. Incourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement services under an AIA A133 contract structure with a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this RFP (the \u201cProject\u201d and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) . The selected Proposer will become the Construction Manager (CM). 1.2 DELIVERY METHOD The delivery method for the Project is \u201c Construction Manager at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133 based contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase. 1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND The Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the historic Tribune Building along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To date, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making process. As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new economy and co mmunity that works well for all. Page 2 To that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local economy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational rentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the functional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow human talent simultaneous to the local economy. The Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the value and importance"

PROJECT INFORMATION 1.1 ABOUT INCOURAGE Established in 1994, Incourage Community Foundation is a nationally recognized leader in place -based philanthropy and community change efforts. Incourage operates with a vision of a community that works well for all people. To achieve this vision, values of equity, inclusion and opportunity are applied to all work, and to the relationships Incourage fosters to accomplish its work. To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and subcontractors who: \uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius; \uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work; \uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work; \uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place; \uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to corporate social responsibility. Incourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement services under an AIA A133 contract structure with a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this RFP (the \u201cProject\u201d and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) .

Page 2 To that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local economy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational rentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the functional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow human talent simultaneous to the local economy. The Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the value and importance"

Forfeiting t he flat fee bonus for not successively passing Gates 1, 2, and 3 does not impact the contractor\u2019s ability to earn fee at the Final Gate. In alignment with the Statement of Objectives, paragraph, 6.15, the contractor is to deliver engineer releases starti ng 120 calendar days after contract award and every 60 days thereafter. It is anticipated there will be a total of 10 engineering releases and 1 final release throughout the PoP of CLIN 0001. Therefore, the defined Gates for this incentive will focus on a subset of those engineering releases and are as stated below: Gate 1 - Engineering Release 3 Gate 2 - Engineering Release 6 Gate 3 - Engineering Release 9 Final Gate - AFATDS 7.0 Baseline Release Gate 1 (Engineering Release 3), Gate 2 (Engineering Release 6), and Gate 3 (Engineering Release 9) The contractor is eligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool for engineering releases 3, 6, and 9 (for a total of 30% of the available 5% fee pool i f each gate is achieved successfully). The contractor is eligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool at each Gate if the engineering release is delivered to the Government with n o Priority 1 or 2 errors; no exceptions. Priority levels are as define d in the AFATDS SRS. There is no limit on Priority 3 or 4 error rates. The data used to substantiate this performance assessment will be the contractor\u2019s testing data supplied in the applicable CDRL A035 \u2013 Software Test Description. Gates 1, 2, and 3 Successively Superior Flat Fee The contractor is eligible to earn 20% of the available 5% fee pool as a flat fee bonus for successively meeting Gates 1, 2, and 3, as defined above. Therefore, if the contractor delivers all thre e engineering releases (engineering releases 3, 6, and 9) with no Priority 1 or 2 errors, they are eligible for the flat fee bonus; no exceptions. As stated under Gates 1, 2, and 3, the priority levels are as defined in the AFATDS SRS. There is no limit on priority 3 or 4 error rates. The data used to substantiate this performance assessment will be the contractor\u2019s testing data supplied in the applicable CDRL A035 \u2013 Software Test Description. HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 88 of 217 Final Gat e The contractor is also eligible for 50% of th e available 5% fee pool if the final gate - AFATDS Baseline Release meets the baseline requirements outlined in AFATDS SRS. Contractor compliance with baseline requirements",
        "will be monitored by the Government via the documented verification and validation method for each requirement as outlined in the AFATDS SRS. The contractor is eligible to earn this fee pool whether or not they\u2019ve earned fee at the previous gateway evaluation s. Below is the formula to be utilized: Agreed Upon Target Cost 100.00 $ a Available Fee 5.00 $ b Gate 1 - Engineering Release 3 0.50 $ b * .1 = c Gate 2 - Engineering Release 6 0.50 $ b * .1 = d Gate 3 - Engineering Release 9 0.50 $ b * .1 = e Gate 1-3 Successive Gate Flat Fee Bonu s 1.00 $ b * .2 = f Fee Subtotal 2.50 $ c+d+e+f = g Final Gate - 7.0 Baseline Release 2.50 $ b * .5 = h Total Fee Earned 5.00 $ g + h = jPerformance Incentive Calculatio n *The above table is an example to show calculation/formula, amounts are subject to the agreed upon target cost. Note: If throughout the course of the contract, the Government approves a request for waiver or request for deviation on a baseline requirement, the contractor will not be subject to assessment on that requirement and full fee can continue to be earned v ia this incentive. 7.3 Incentive #3: Performance & Schedule (2% Flat Fee Bonus/Disincentive) This incentive is a Gateway Fee incentive that builds off of Incentive #2, Final Gate. The contractor is only eligible for this 2% Flat Fee Bonus if the co ntractor achieves the Final Gate under Incentive # 2, as it is not the Government intention to provide a bonus for providing a software baseline on time that does not meet baseline requirements. Incentive Therefore, if the contractor successfully clear s the Final Gate under Incentive #2 no later than 26 months after award, the contractor is eligible for a flat fee of 2% of the target cost. The 2% fee allocated to this incentive is based upon the agreed upon target cost and does no t increase/decrease if the contractor realizes a Target Cost Underrun/Overrun. The fee available for this incentive will be set at time of awar d based upon the agreed upon target cost and available target fee. Disincentive Conversely, if the contractor fails the final gate under Incentive #2 AND does no t deliver the AFATDS 7.0 baseline within 26 months of award, the contractor will pay the Government liquidated damages of 2% of the target cost. In a situation where the contractor fails the final gate of Incentive #2, but the Government decides to take acceptance of the AFATDS 7.0 baseline with known deficiencies within 26 months of award in order to HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 89 of 217 ensure the delivery of some capability to the Army Force, the contractor w ill not be assesse d for liquidated damages. A Government decision to assume greater risk and accept a delinquent AFATDS v7.0 final release does NOT result in the contractor being eligible"

HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 183 of 217 6.0 Volum e IV - Cost/Price (Evaluation Factor 5) The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated, using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is reasonable and complete; a color rating is not assigned to the cost/price factor. Normally, price reasonableness is established through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. The Government will determine completeness of the offeror's proposal by verifying that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs are presented in a clear and useful format. The Government will evaluate offerors' proposed costs for reasonableness, completeness, affordability and realism. 6.1 General Instructions 6.1.1 Cost Reasonableness, Realism, and Completeness This section is to assist you in submitting cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the reasonableness, completeness, realism, balance, and/or affordability of your proposed cost. The Government will v erify that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly calculated, and prices are presented in a clear and useful format. Note that unrealistically low or high proposed costs, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for elimina ting a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has submitted an unrealistic proposal. Additionally, unbalanced costs pose an unacceptable risk to the Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror\u2019s proposal. Cost submissions should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness and be adequate enough to support and sustain a DCAA audit. 6.1.2 Cost/Price Information Information beyond that required by this instruction shall not be submitted, unless you consider it essential to document or support your cost/price position. All information relating to the proposed price, including all required supporting documentation must be included in the section of the proposal designated as the Cost/Price Volume. Under no circumstances shall this information and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal . Labor and overhead rates should include sufficient detail to sustain a DCAA audit (e.g., direct labor rates, overhead, fring e benefits, General and Administrative Expense (G&A), fee, etc.). The offeror must provide the basis of estimate for all rates with detailed rationale to support the rates. For indirect rates, the preferred method for providing support detail is throug h the submission of a Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) or Forward Pricing Rate Recommendation (FPRR). However, in the absence of a FPRA/FPRR, the Government will accept all rates and factors by year utilized in the development of the Forward Pricing R ate Proposal and the basis for these rates and factors (e.g., breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data). If the contractor is not required to maintain forward pricing rates then the Government will accept other methods of validation. These methods include approved provisional billing rates, other submitted/approved rates, or",
        "the submission of proposed rate calculations (including the pools & bases) and the basis of all calculations (e.g., breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data). The offeror shall state if rates have been provided to the cognizant Administrative Contracting HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 184 of 217 Officer /DCAA office for review or negotiation; if rates have not been submitted, explanation is required. If a subcontractor relationship exists, subcontract costs must also be deline ated in accordance with the requirements above. If needed, the subcontract may submit its unsanitized cost breakout directly to the Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer. The subcontractor shall also provide contact information for its cognizant DCAA o ffice. 6.1.3 Cost or Pricing Information Requirement s In accordance with FAR 15.403 -1(b) and 15.403 -3(a), data other than certified cost or pricing data may be required to support cos t reasonableness. Information shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403 -5. If, after r eceipt of proposals, the contracting officer determines the required conditions of adequate competition do not exist that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403 -1 apply, the offeror may be required to certify its submitted cost or pricing data . 6.2 Volume Organization The Cost/Price volume shall consist of the following sections : Part A -Introductio n Table of Contents; summary descriptions of estimating, purchasing, and accounting systems; changes to estimating, accounting practices, or Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) d isclosure statement . Part B -Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet s Cost or pricing information and supporting data, to include estimating methodology . Part C - Other informatio n Such as GFE, DCAA information, long lead costs, termination costs, development/production schedule, inflation rate summary and explanation, life cycle cost, and special tooling/test equipment. List each exception to the ground rules and assumptions provided in the solicitation and each qualification of the Cost/Price vol ume, if any. Provide complete rationale for any exceptions . 6.3 Part A -Introductio n 6.3.1 Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms. If necessary, provide a glossary of abbreviations and acronyms used with an explanation for each. Glossaries do not count against the page limitations for their respective volumes . 6.3.2 Estimating Syste m Provide a summary description of your standard estimating system or methods.

The Contractor will assist the Government in the selection of appropriate controls by identification of the security con trol baseline for the system, and documenting these in the SSP. Baseline controls and control overlays will be tailored for the system. Overlays may add or subtract security controls, or provide additional guidance regarding security controls, resulting i n a set of security controls applicable to the system that is a combination of the baseline and overlay. The combination of baselines and overlays address the unique security protection needs associated with the system. If necessary, control sets will b e tailored (modified) in response to increased risk from changes in threats or vulnerabilities, or variations in risk tolerance. Tailoring decisions must be coordinated with the Government, and aligned with operational considerations and the system environ ment. Security controls will be added or removed only as a function of specified, ris k-based determinations. Tailoring decisions, including the specific rationale (e.g., mapping to risk tolerance) for those decisions, will be documented in the security plan for the system. A monitoring strategy must be developed and documented as a syste m-level strategy for the continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of security controls employed within or inherited by the system, and monitoring of any proposed or ac tual changes to the system and its environment of operation. The strategy must include the plan for annual assessments of a subset of implemented security controls, and the level of independence required of the assessor (e.g., Information System Security M anager (ISSM) or Security Control Assessor (SCA)).

The evaluation will also be used by DISA and other Government agencies as source selection information to support future Government procurements . H.5 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI)/OCI MITIGATION PLA N a. An organizational conflict of interest means that because of othe r activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a perso n has an unfair competitive advantage. The Government seeks to acquire unbiased advi ce and/or goods and services from offerors/contractors that are free from, or have mitigated, Organizational Conflicts of Interest , as defined in FAR 2.101, relating to this contract . b. In order for the Government to try to prevent an OCI relating to this contract, the parties to this contract agree that the contractor\u2019s future contracting with the Government may be restricted as outlined in FAR Subpart 9.5, if the offeror/ contractor and DISA are unable to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate actual or potential OCI before contract award . c. DISA will not automatically exclude a vendor from a competitive acquisition due to an actual or potential OCI. The Contracting Office is comm itted to working with potential vendors to eliminate or mitigate actual and potential OCI situations, without detriment to the integrity of the competitive process, the DISA mission, or the legitimate business interests of the vendor community . d. If the off eror or contractor is aware, or should have been aware, of an OCI before award of this contract or any task under against the contract, and does not fully disclose that conflict to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contractor for de fault. HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 69 of 217 e. The offeror or contractor, by submitting an offer and/or signing the contract, warrants that it is not now aware of any actual or potential OCI relating to this contract . f. After contract award, the contractor shall have an ongoing obligation to make \u201ca prompt and full disclosure\u201d to the Contracting Officer of any OCI that arises during the performance of the contract, as well as newly discovered conflicts that existed before contract award . g. The OCI Mitigation Plan shall become part of the resultant contract and the contractor shall update its OCI Mitigation Plan within 30 days of any changes to the legal construct of the organization, subcontractor changes, or significant management or ownership changes that would result in an actual or potential OC I under this contract .

AFATDS enables the Force Commander\u2019s guidance to be automatically applied in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan, execute, and deliver e ffects at all levels of command within the current and future force. AFATDS can automatically tailor the selection of fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters and offensive electronic warfare asset s) based on Commander\u2019s Guidance, thereby enabling maximum effective use of all available fire support assets across the full spectrum of conflict . It is the Government\u2019s objective to modernize the underlying AFATDS architecture, redesign the AFATDS fron t- end to a fully web and role based interface, integrate available common services made available through the Army\u2019s Common Operating Environment (CO E) and incorporate advanced embedded training technologies to aid in operator initiated system instruction and refresher training. This next generation version of AFATDS is referred to as AFATDS 7.0. 4. Objective s: To procure an innovative and stat e-of-the-art solution that provides a modernized backend AFATDS architecture; incorporates the common services provided by COE Version 3 (v3); implements role duty based functionality; and provides embedded computer based training . 5. Scop e. Scope of the effort includes system architecture design and analysis, system software interface support, design/system engineering and system integration. This effort also includes software design and development, HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 53 of 217 programmatic, engineering, testing, train ing, and integration for the implementation of the AFATDS capability in support of fires operational requirements within the Army and USMC operational architecture from fires platoon to echelon above Corps, Joint and Coalition command staffs, ASCA, and ot her international agreements. 6.

Past Performance Facto r The technical/management approach factor is more important than the past performance factor. In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. The past per formance evaluation factor assesses the degree of confidence the Government has in an offeror\u2019s ability to supply products and services that meet users\u2019 needs, based on a demonstrated record of performance.

Recent contracts are considered to be efforts that the prime offeror and its teaming partners, joint venture or s ignificant subcontractors have performed within the past five years prior to original issuance of the solicitation, or for ongoing efforts the period of performance of which must have started at least nine months before the original proposal due date.

For each recent past performance reference reviewed, the relevance of the work HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 213 of 217 performed will generally be assessed as compared to the technical/management factor.
