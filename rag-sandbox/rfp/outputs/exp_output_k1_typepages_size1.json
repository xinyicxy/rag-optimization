Include in its contracts with any and all subcontractors the requirements of a, b, and, c \nabove.  \n \n13.   Liability Coverage  \n \n Unless otherwise expressly excepted in the procurement announcement documents prepared by the \nCounty, the Contractor shall take out and maintain during the life of the Contract such bodily injury, liability \nand property damage liability insurance as shall protect it and the County from claims for damages for \npersonal injury, including death, as  well as from claims for property damage, which may arise from its \nactivities under this agreement.  Such insurance shall at least have the coverages and be in the amounts set \nforth in section 15 \"Insurance and Bond Requirements \" set forth below and shall name the Board of \nSupervisors and the County as  Additional Insureds.  Such insurance must be issued by a company admitted \nwithin the Commonwealth of Virginia and with at least a Best 's Key Rating of A:V1.  The Contractor shall \nprovide the County with a ce rtificate of insurance showing such insurance to be in force and providing that \nthe insurer shall give the County at least 30 days ' notice prior to cancellation or other termination of such \ninsurance.  \n \n14.   Loss or Damage in Transit  \n \n Delivery by a contractor t o a common carrier does not constitute delivery to state agencies or \npolitical subdivisions.  Any claim for loss or damage incurred during delivery shall be between the contractor \nand the carrier.  The state accepts title only when goods are received regar dless of the F.O.B. point.  The \nreceiving agency will note all apparent damages in transit on the freight bill and notify the contractor.  \nDiscovery of concealed damages or loss will be reported by the receiving agency to the carrier and the \ncontractor wit hin seven days of receipt and prior to removal from the point of delivery if possible.  The \ncontractor shall make immediate replacement of the damaged or lost merchandise or be in default of the \ncontract.  It shall be the contractor 's responsibility to file a claim against the carrier.  If damage is to a small \nquantity, with the approval of the agency, the contractor may deduct the amount of damage or loss from his \nor her invoice to the agency in lieu of replacement.  \n \n15.   Freight  \n \n By signing an I .F.B. the bidd er certifies that the bid price(s) offered for F.O.B. destination include \nonly the actual freight charges at the lowest and best rate and is based upon the actual weight of the goods to \nbe shipped.  Freight charges are, therefore, established for each indi vidual purchase.  If a requirement is bid \nF.O.B. origin, the contractor shall prepay the charges and add the amount to the invoice.  A copy of the \nfreight bill should be attached to all invoices that include freight charges.  In a solicitation specifying F .O.B. \norigin the state will consider freight cost in the evaluation of bids.  \n \n16.   Termination for Default    \n \nIn case of default by a contractor for failure to deliver or perform in accordance with the contract \nspecifications or terms and conditions, the County  may procure the articles or services from other sources and \nhold the defaulting contractor responsible for any resulting additional purchase and administrative costs.  The \nCounty will normally repurchase from the next low bidder or purchase competitively by resolicitation.  If the \nrepurchase results in increased costs to the County, a letter will be sent to the defaulted contractor required \npayment for additional costs.  When repayment is requested, the contractor will be removed from future \nbidding until the repayment has occurred.  Contractors shall not be liable for any excess cost if the failure to \nperform arises out of any act of war, order of legal authority, strikes, act of God, or other unavoidable causes "

Normally, price reasonableness is established through cost and  \nprice analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.  The Government will determine  \ncompleteness of the offeror's proposal by verifying that all solicitation requirements have been  \npriced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs are presented in a clear and useful format.

Note that unrealistically low or  \nhigh proposed costs, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for elimina ting a proposal from  \ncompetition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has  \nsubmitted an unrealistic proposal.  Additionally, unbalanced costs pose an unacceptable risk to \nthe Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror\u2019s proposal.

All information relating to the  \nproposed price, including all required supporting documentation must be included in the section \nof the proposal designated as the Cost/Price Volume.  Under no circumstances shall this  \ninformation and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal . \n \nLabor and overhead rates should include sufficient detail to sustain a DCAA audit (e.g., direct  \nlabor rates, overhead, fring e benefits, General and Administrative Expense (G&A), fee, etc.).   \n The offeror must provide the basis of estimate for all rates with detailed rationale to support the  \nrates.  For indirect rates, the preferred method for providing support detail is throug h the \nsubmission of a Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) or Forward Pricing Rate  \nRecommendation (FPRR).  However, in the absence of a FPRA/FPRR, the Government will  \naccept all rates and factors by year utilized in the development of the Forward Pricing R ate \nProposal and the basis for these rates and factors (e.g., breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data).  If the contractor is not required to maintain forward pricing rates then the Government will  \naccept other methods of validation.  These methods include  approved provisional billing rates, \nother submitted/approved rates, or the submission of proposed rate calculations (including the  \npools & bases) and the basis of all calculations (e.g., breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data).

DISA will not automatically exclude a vendor from a competitive acquisition due to  \nan actual or potential OCI.  The Contracting Office is comm itted to working with  \npotential vendors to eliminate or mitigate actual and potential OCI situations, without detriment to the integrity of the competitive process, the DISA mission, or the  \nlegitimate business interests of the vendor community . \n \nd. If the off eror or contractor is aware, or should have been aware, of an OCI before  \naward of this contract or any task under against the contract, and does not fully  \ndisclose that conflict to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the  \ncontractor for de fault. \n "
