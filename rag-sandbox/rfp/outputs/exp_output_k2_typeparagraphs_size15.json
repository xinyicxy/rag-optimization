To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and \nsubcontractors who:  \n\n\uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius;  \n\uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work;  \n\uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work;  \n\uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place;  \n\uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to \ncorporate social responsibility.  \n\nIncourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement  services under an AIA A133 contract \nstructure with  a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this  \nRFP (the  \u201cProject\u201d  and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) . The selected Proposer will become the \nConstruction Manager  (CM).  \n\n1.2 DELIVERY METHOD  \nThe delivery method for the Project is \u201c Construction Manager  at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133 \nbased contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase.    \n\n1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND  \nThe Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the \nhistoric Tribune Building  along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To \ndate, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making \nprocess.  As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new \neconomy and co mmunity that works well for all.  \nPage 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n\n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n\nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n\n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.  \n\n\uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \n\n\uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C.  \n\nAll Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP.  \n\n1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American \nInstitute of Architects)  \nConstruction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction \nManager before the design stage is complete.

        "2.1 PRECONSTRUCTION PHASE  \n\n Consultation  \nThe Construction Manager  shall meet with the Architect and Owner to discuss such matters as procedures, \nprogress, coord ination, and scheduling of th e work. The Construction Manager  shall advise the Owner and the \nArchitect on proposed site use and improvements , selection of materials, and building systems and equipment. \nThe Construction Manager  shall also provide recommendations consistent with the Pro ject requirements to the \nOwner and Architect on constructability; availability of materials and labor; time requirements for procurement, \ninstallation and construction; and factors related to construction cos t including, but not limited to:  costs of \naltern ative designs or materials, preliminary budgets, life -cycle data, and possible cost reductions.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall provide recommendations with regard to accelerated or fast -track scheduling, \nprocurement, or phased construction. The Construction Manager  shall take into consideration cost reductions, \ncost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction \nscheduling issues.   \n\nPreliminary  Cost  Estimates  \nBased on the preliminary design and  other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate  of Probable \nCost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager  suggests alternative materials and systems, the \nConstruction Manager  shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems.  \n\nAs the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design  Documents, the Construction Manager  shall \nprepare  estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further \ndevelopment of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager  agree on a Guaranteed \nMaximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s \napproval  prior to the completion of each phase . The Construction Manage r shall inform the Owner and Architect \nwhen estimates of the Cost of the Work exceed the latest approved Project budget and make recommendations \nfor corrective action.   \n\nGuaranteed  Maximum  Price  Proposal  and Contract  Time  \nAt a time to be mutually agreed up on by the Owner and the Construction Manager  and in consultation with the \nArchitect, the Construction Manager  shall prepare a detailed line item  Guaranteed Maximum Price Proposal for \nthe Owner\u2019s review and acceptance.  The Guaranteed Maximum Price in the pr oposal shall be the sum of the \nConstruction Manager \u2019s estimate of the Cost of the Work and the Construction Manager \u2019s Fee for the \nConstruction Phase as quoted in the Proposer\u2019s response to this RFP.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall include with the Guarant eed Maximum Price proposal a written statement of its \nbasis, which shall include the following:  \n 1. A list of the Drawings and Specifications, including all Addenda thereto, and the Conditions of the \nContract;  \n 2. A list of the clarifications and assumptions made by the Construction Manager  in the preparation of \nthe Guaranteed Maximum Price proposal,  \n 3. A statement of the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price, including a statement of the estimated \nCost of the Work organized by trade categories or systems, allowances, contingency, and the \nConstruction Manager \u2019s Fee;  \n 4. A schedule of milestones for the comple tion and the anticipated date of Substantial Completion upon \nwhich the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price is based;  \n 5. A Schedule of Value for each component of work to be undertaken; and \n 6. A date by which the Owner must accept the Guaranteed Maximum Pr ice.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall meet with the Owner and Architect to review the Guaranteed Maximum Price \nproposal.  Once a Guaranteed Maximum Price has been agreed upon by all parties, the Owner and Construction \nManager  shall execute the Guaranteed M aximum Price Amendment to the Contract.  The Guaranteed Maximum Page 4 \nPrice Amendment shall set forth the agreed upon Guaranteed Maximum Price with the information and \nassumptions upon which it is based  and shall include a Schedule of Values .  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall guarantee that the Contract Sum shall not exceed the Guaranteed Maximum \nPrice set forth in the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment, as it is amended from time to time.  To the extent \nthe Cost of the Work exceeds the Guaranteed Maximum Price, t he Construction Manager  shall bear such costs in \nexcess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price without reimbursement or additional compensation from the Owner.   \nThe Construction Manager will acknowledge that the Construction Manager is an experienced contractor a nd \nthat (subject to Acts of God) the Project can be completed for Guaranteed Maximum Price.  \n\nSubcontractors  and Suppliers  \nThose portions of the Work that the Construction Manager  does not customarily perform with the Construction \nManager \u2019s own personnel s hall be performed under subcontracts or by other appropriate agreements with the \nConstruction Manager . The Owner may designate specific persons from whom, or entities from which, the \nConstruction Manager  shall obtain bids. Subcontractors must be located 50 miles  or less from the Project site , \nunless a greater distance is approved by the Owner.  The Construction Manager  shall obtain at least three \nproposals from Subcontractors and from suppliers of materials or equipment fabricated especially for the Work \nand shall deliver suc h proposals  to the Owner. The Owner shall then determine, with the advice of the \nConstruction Manager  and the Architect, which bids will be accepted. The Construction Manager  shall not be \nrequired to contract with anyone to whom the Const ruction Manager  has reasonable objection.  \n\nIf the Guaranteed Maximum Price has been established and a specifi c subcontractor or supplier  (1) is \nrecommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager , (2) is qualified to perform that portion of the Work, \nand (3) has submitted a  proposal  that conforms to the requirements of the Contract Documents without \nreservations or exceptions, but the Owner requires that another  proposal  be accepted, then the Construction \nManager  may require that a Change Order be issued t o adjust the Guaranteed Maximum Price by the difference \nbetween the bid of the person or entity recommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager  and the \nproposal  of  the person or entity designated by the Owner.  \n\n2.2 CONSTRUCTION PHASE  \n\nThe Construction Phase shall commence upon the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment or \nthe Owner\u2019s issuance of a Notice to Proceed, whichever occurs earlier.  \n\nChanges  in the Work  \nThe Owner may, without invalidating the Contract, order changes in  the Work within the general scope of the \nContract consisting of additions, deletions or other revisions. The Architect  shall issue such changes in writing  \nand all change orders will be signed and acknowledged by Owner and Construction Manager . The Constru ction \nManager  shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the Contract Time as a result of changes in the Work.  \n\nChange orders issued by the Owner subsequent to the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment \nshall constitute adjustments to the  Guaranteed Maximum Price.

To achieve this vision, values of equity, inclusion and opportunity are applied to all work, and to the \nrelationships Incourage fosters to accomplish its work. To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and \nsubcontractors who:  \n\n\uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius;  \n\uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work;  \n\uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work;  \n\uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place;  \n\uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to \ncorporate social responsibility.  \n\nIncourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement  services under an AIA A133 contract \nstructure with  a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this  \nRFP (the  \u201cProject\u201d  and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) . The selected Proposer will become the \nConstruction Manager  (CM).  \n\n1.2 DELIVERY METHOD  \nThe delivery method for the Project is \u201c Construction Manager  at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133 \nbased contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase.    \n\n1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND  \nThe Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the \nhistoric Tribune Building  along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To \ndate, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making \nprocess.  As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new \neconomy and co mmunity that works well for all.  \nPage 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n\n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n\nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n\n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.  \n\n\uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \n\n\uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C.  \n\nAll Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP.  \n\n1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American \nInstitute of Architects)  \nConstruction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction \nManager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n\n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2. The Owner and Construction Manager  \nmay agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of \nthe Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall \nidentify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project.   Page 3 \nThe Construction Manager  will be required to hold a Construction Manager s\u2019 license  (or applicable license)  valid \nfor the State of Wisconsin . "

The Construction Manager  shall take into consideration cost reductions, \ncost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction \nscheduling issues.   \n\nPreliminary  Cost  Estimates  \nBased on the preliminary design and  other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate  of Probable \nCost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager  suggests alternative materials and systems, the \nConstruction Manager  shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems.  \n\nAs the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design  Documents, the Construction Manager  shall \nprepare  estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further \ndevelopment of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager  agree on a Guaranteed \nMaximum Price for the Work.

(\u201cIncourage\u201d)  located in rural central Wisconsin, invites proposals  from \ninterested firms  for Construction Management services on the Tribune Building Project (located at 220 First \nAvenue South, Wisconsin Rapids).  \n\nSubmission Deadline:      Friday, February 13, 2015  at 4:0 0 p.m. CST  \n  \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \n1 Project Information  \n2 Scope of Services \u2013 Construction Manager \u2019s Responsibilities  \n3 Owner\u2019s Responsibilities  \n4 Insurance and Bonds  \n5 Proposal Format  \n6 Proposal Submittal  \n7 Proposer \u2019s Site Visit &  Q&A Session  \n8 Final Selection  \n9 Additional Information Requests  \n  \n1. PROJECT INFORMATION  \n\n1.1   ABOUT INCOURAGE  \nEstablished in 1994, Incourage Community Foundation is a nationally recognized leader in place -based \nphilanthropy and community change efforts.  Incourage operates with a vision of a community that works well for \nall people. To achieve this vision, values of equity, inclusion and opportunity are applied to all work, and to the \nrelationships Incourage fosters to accomplish its work. To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and \nsubcontractors who:  \n\n\uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius;  \n\uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work;  \n\uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work;  \n\uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place;  \n\uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to \ncorporate social responsibility.  \n\nIncourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement  services under an AIA A133 contract \nstructure with  a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this  \nRFP (the  \u201cProject\u201d  and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) . The selected Proposer will become the \nConstruction Manager  (CM).  \n\n1.2 DELIVERY METHOD  \nThe delivery method for the Project is \u201c Construction Manager  at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133 \nbased contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase.    \n\n1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND  \nThe Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the \nhistoric Tribune Building  along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To \ndate, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making \nprocess.  As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new \neconomy and co mmunity that works well for all.  \nPage 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n\n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n\nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n\n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.  \n\n\uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \n\n\uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C.  \n\nAll Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP.  \n\n1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American \nInstitute of Architects)  \nConstruction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction \nManager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n\n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES \u2013 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER \u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe Construction Manager \u2019s Preconstruction Phase responsibi lities are set forth in Section  2.1. The Construction \nManager \u2019s Construction Phase responsibilities are set forth in Section 2.2. The Owner and Construction Manager  \nmay agree, in consultation with the Architect, for the Construction Phase to commence prior to completion of \nthe Preconstruction Phase, in which case, both  phases will proceed concurrently. The Construction Manager  shall \nidentify a representative authorized to act on behalf of the Construction Manager  with respect to the Project.   Page 3 \nThe Construction Manager  will be required to hold a Construction Manager s\u2019 license  (or applicable license)  valid \nfor the State of Wisconsin . ",
        "2.1 PRECONSTRUCTION PHASE  \n\n Consultation  \nThe Construction Manager  shall meet with the Architect and Owner to discuss such matters as procedures, \nprogress, coord ination, and scheduling of th e work. The Construction Manager  shall advise the Owner and the \nArchitect on proposed site use and improvements , selection of materials, and building systems and equipment. \nThe Construction Manager  shall also provide recommendations consistent with the Pro ject requirements to the \nOwner and Architect on constructability; availability of materials and labor; time requirements for procurement, \ninstallation and construction; and factors related to construction cos t including, but not limited to:  costs of \naltern ative designs or materials, preliminary budgets, life -cycle data, and possible cost reductions.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall provide recommendations with regard to accelerated or fast -track scheduling, \nprocurement, or phased construction. The Construction Manager  shall take into consideration cost reductions, \ncost information, constructability, provisions for temporary facilities and procurement and construction \nscheduling issues.   \n\nPreliminary  Cost  Estimates  \nBased on the preliminary design and  other design criteria, the Architect has prepared an Estimate  of Probable \nCost (Exhibit B). If the Architect or Construction Manager  suggests alternative materials and systems, the \nConstruction Manager  shall provide cost evaluations of those alternative m aterials and systems.  \n\nAs the Architect progresses with the preparation of the Design  Documents, the Construction Manager  shall \nprepare  estimates of the Cost of the Work of increasing detail and refinement and allowing for the further \ndevelopment of the de sign until such time as the Owner and Construction Manager  agree on a Guaranteed \nMaximum Price for the Work. Such estimates shall be provided for the Architect\u2019s review and the Owner\u2019s \napproval  prior to the completion of each phase . The Construction Manage r shall inform the Owner and Architect \nwhen estimates of the Cost of the Work exceed the latest approved Project budget and make recommendations \nfor corrective action.   \n\nGuaranteed  Maximum  Price  Proposal  and Contract  Time  \nAt a time to be mutually agreed up on by the Owner and the Construction Manager  and in consultation with the \nArchitect, the Construction Manager  shall prepare a detailed line item  Guaranteed Maximum Price Proposal for \nthe Owner\u2019s review and acceptance.  The Guaranteed Maximum Price in the pr oposal shall be the sum of the \nConstruction Manager \u2019s estimate of the Cost of the Work and the Construction Manager \u2019s Fee for the \nConstruction Phase as quoted in the Proposer\u2019s response to this RFP.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall include with the Guarant eed Maximum Price proposal a written statement of its \nbasis, which shall include the following:  \n 1. A list of the Drawings and Specifications, including all Addenda thereto, and the Conditions of the \nContract;  \n 2. A list of the clarifications and assumptions made by the Construction Manager  in the preparation of \nthe Guaranteed Maximum Price proposal,  \n 3. A statement of the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price, including a statement of the estimated \nCost of the Work organized by trade categories or systems, allowances, contingency, and the \nConstruction Manager \u2019s Fee;  \n 4. A schedule of milestones for the comple tion and the anticipated date of Substantial Completion upon \nwhich the proposed Guaranteed Maximum Price is based;  \n 5. A Schedule of Value for each component of work to be undertaken; and \n 6. A date by which the Owner must accept the Guaranteed Maximum Pr ice.  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall meet with the Owner and Architect to review the Guaranteed Maximum Price \nproposal.  Once a Guaranteed Maximum Price has been agreed upon by all parties, the Owner and Construction \nManager  shall execute the Guaranteed M aximum Price Amendment to the Contract.  The Guaranteed Maximum Page 4 \nPrice Amendment shall set forth the agreed upon Guaranteed Maximum Price with the information and \nassumptions upon which it is based  and shall include a Schedule of Values .  \n\nThe Construction Manager  shall guarantee that the Contract Sum shall not exceed the Guaranteed Maximum \nPrice set forth in the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment, as it is amended from time to time.  To the extent \nthe Cost of the Work exceeds the Guaranteed Maximum Price, t he Construction Manager  shall bear such costs in \nexcess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price without reimbursement or additional compensation from the Owner.   \nThe Construction Manager will acknowledge that the Construction Manager is an experienced contractor a nd \nthat (subject to Acts of God) the Project can be completed for Guaranteed Maximum Price.  \n\nSubcontractors  and Suppliers  \nThose portions of the Work that the Construction Manager  does not customarily perform with the Construction \nManager \u2019s own personnel s hall be performed under subcontracts or by other appropriate agreements with the \nConstruction Manager . The Owner may designate specific persons from whom, or entities from which, the \nConstruction Manager  shall obtain bids. Subcontractors must be located 50 miles  or less from the Project site , \nunless a greater distance is approved by the Owner.  The Construction Manager  shall obtain at least three \nproposals from Subcontractors and from suppliers of materials or equipment fabricated especially for the Work \nand shall deliver suc h proposals  to the Owner. The Owner shall then determine, with the advice of the \nConstruction Manager  and the Architect, which bids will be accepted. The Construction Manager  shall not be \nrequired to contract with anyone to whom the Const ruction Manager  has reasonable objection.  \n\nIf the Guaranteed Maximum Price has been established and a specifi c subcontractor or supplier  (1) is \nrecommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager , (2) is qualified to perform that portion of the Work, \nand (3) has submitted a  proposal  that conforms to the requirements of the Contract Documents without \nreservations or exceptions, but the Owner requires that another  proposal  be accepted, then the Construction \nManager  may require that a Change Order be issued t o adjust the Guaranteed Maximum Price by the difference \nbetween the bid of the person or entity recommended to the Owner by the Construction Manager  and the \nproposal  of  the person or entity designated by the Owner.  \n\n2.2 CONSTRUCTION PHASE  \n\nThe Construction Phase shall commence upon the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment or \nthe Owner\u2019s issuance of a Notice to Proceed, whichever occurs earlier.  \n\nChanges  in the Work  \nThe Owner may, without invalidating the Contract, order changes in  the Work within the general scope of the \nContract consisting of additions, deletions or other revisions. The Architect  shall issue such changes in writing  \nand all change orders will be signed and acknowledged by Owner and Construction Manager . The Constru ction \nManager  shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the Contract Time as a result of changes in the Work.  \n\nChange orders issued by the Owner subsequent to the execution of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Amendment \nshall constitute adjustments to the  Guaranteed Maximum Price.

PROJECT INFORMATION  \n\n1.1   ABOUT INCOURAGE  \nEstablished in 1994, Incourage Community Foundation is a nationally recognized leader in place -based \nphilanthropy and community change efforts.  Incourage operates with a vision of a community that works well for \nall people. To achieve this vision, values of equity, inclusion and opportunity are applied to all work, and to the \nrelationships Incourage fosters to accomplish its work. To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and \nsubcontractors who:  \n\n\uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius;  \n\uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work;  \n\uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work;  \n\uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place;  \n\uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to \ncorporate social responsibility.  \n\nIncourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement  services under an AIA A133 contract \nstructure with  a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this  \nRFP (the  \u201cProject\u201d  and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) . The selected Proposer will become the \nConstruction Manager  (CM).  \n\n1.2 DELIVERY METHOD  \nThe delivery method for the Project is \u201c Construction Manager  at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133 \nbased contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase.    \n\n1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND  \nThe Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the \nhistoric Tribune Building  along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To \ndate, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making \nprocess.  As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new \neconomy and co mmunity that works well for all.  \nPage 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n\n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n\nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n\n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.  \n\n\uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \n\n\uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C.  \n\nAll Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP.  \n\n1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American \nInstitute of Architects)  \nConstruction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction \nManager before the design stage is complete. The Construction Manager is chosen based on qualifications, and \nthen the entire operation is centralized under a single contract. The Architect and Construction Manager w ork \ntogether in order to cultivate and assay the design. Then, the Construction Manager gives the client a \nGuaranteed Maximum Price, and coordinates all subcontract work. The Architect/Engineer is hired separately \nfrom the Construction Manager at -risk and the traditional client \u2013 Architect/Engineer relationship is maintained.  \n\n2.

PROJECT INFORMATION  \n\n1.1   ABOUT INCOURAGE  \nEstablished in 1994, Incourage Community Foundation is a nationally recognized leader in place -based \nphilanthropy and community change efforts.  Incourage operates with a vision of a community that works well for \nall people. To achieve this vision, values of equity, inclusion and opportunity are applied to all work, and to the \nrelationships Incourage fosters to accomplish its work. To this end, Incourage strives to work with vendors and \nsubcontractors who:  \n\n\uf0b7 Are located in the local community or within a 200-mile radius;  \n\uf0b7 Hire qualified, diverse talent, who are equitably paid for their work;  \n\uf0b7 Value learning opportunities or practices, and building capacity of their team or others involved in the work;  \n\uf0b7 Can demonstrate a connection to place;  \n\uf0b7 Have an eye on sustainability (of environment and business) and have demonstrated a commi tment to \ncorporate social responsibility.  \n\nIncourage is seeking proposals to provide Construction Manag ement  services under an AIA A133 contract \nstructure with  a guaranteed maximum price on the major renovation of the Tribune Building, as described in this  \nRFP (the  \u201cProject\u201d  and sometimes the \u201cTribune Building Project\u201d) . The selected Proposer will become the \nConstruction Manager  (CM).  \n\n1.2 DELIVERY METHOD  \nThe delivery method for the Project is \u201c Construction Manager  at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133 \nbased contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase.    \n\n1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND  \nThe Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the \nhistoric Tribune Building  along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To \ndate, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making \nprocess.  As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new \neconomy and co mmunity that works well for all.  \nPage 2 \nTo that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local \neconomy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational \nrentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the \nfunctional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow \nhuman talent simultaneous to the local economy.  \nThe Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the \nvalue and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment  that fosters and accepts failure; \ncreativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship.  \n1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT   \nIn 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of \nConsolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more \nthan a century.  At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.  The dramatic \neconomic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency \nwould not serve their changed circumstances.   The Tribune Building Project seeks to support residents in \ndetermining their own identity.  By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the \ncom munity\u2019s future.   \n\n1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE  \nThe Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets.  \nBoth the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are \nalready meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area.  The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local \nnewspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design.  \nThe building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant.  The revitalization will undoubtedly alter \nthe deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper \nindustry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an \naccessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers.  The \nTribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown  and riverfront renaissance.   \n\nThe Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids.  \n\n\uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A.  \n\n\uf0b7 An Estimate  of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \n\n\uf0b7 A Project Timeline  is provided  in Exhi bit C.  \n\nAll Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP.  \n\n1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY  BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American \nInstitute of Architects)  \nConstruction Management at -risk is a process that allows the  Owner  of a Project to choose the Construction \nManager before the design stage is complete.

AFATDS 7.0 will support new munitions variants, to include smart  \nmunitions that will encompass but not be restricted to the following types:  HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  19 of 217 \n\n a) New and/or improved artillery, shell, fuze, propellants; b) New and/or  \nimproved mortar munitions for Army and the Marine Corps EFSS system;  \nand c) New and/or improved Rocket Missile Munitions.  These munitions  \nwill have new ranges, lethality, accuracy, and/or shell/fuze/charge \ncombinations.  T hese updated characteristics will be reflected in the \nappropriate AFATDS 7.0 components as determined by munition type . \n b. AFATDS 7.0 will support upgrades to existing weapon platforms, new  \nweapon platforms or platform variants, to include hosted fire contr ol \nsystems (e.g.  Paladin, M777, MLRS, HIMARS, EFSS, Mortar Systems, \nM119A 3).   \n c. AFATDS 7.0 will accommodate changes in message data to/from  \nplatforms to support new ballistic and non -ballistic trajectory, range, and  \nrate requirements.   \n d. AFATDS 7.0 will s upport the elimination of outdated munitions and \nweapon systems . \n e. AFATDS 7.0 will support enhancement of current behavior that supports  \ncurrent platforms and munitions.  This will include but not be limited to:  multiple precision targets; mixed munitions l oads; mixed weapon types  \nwithin unit; increased message automation (fewer manual Class 3  \nmessages); and longer range communications with platforms . \n\nf. The AFATDS 7.0 r e-architecting and modernization efforts will not in any  \nway result in capability or inter operability loss.  The same capabilities that \ncan be performed by AFATDS 6.8.1.1 today will still be available from  \nthe AFATDS 7.0 system, unless otherwise noted in the AFATDS 7.0 SRS . \n\n6.2.2 Subtask 2-  Capability Retirement and Consolidatio n \n\nAFATDS 7.0 will re tire and consolidate the following:   \n\na. ATLAS  \u2013 ATLAS will no longer be supported as an individual end item  \nwithin the AFATDS product line.  Collaborative functionality previously  \nmade available via ATLAS will be supported within the collaboration \nservices  made available to AFATDS 7.0 . \n\nb. EMT \u2013 EMT will no longer be supported as an individual end item within \nthe AFATDS product line.  The capability previously exposed via EMT  \nwill be found within AFATDS 7.0.   \n\nc.

Meeting the needs of both environments will require AFATDS 7.0 to be  \naccessible from both web and smart client devices.  When operating via a Web  \nClient, AFATDS 7.0 will support all versions of ozone and the joint comm and \nand control common user interface that are targeted for COE v3 along with associated browsers.

When operating on a Smart Client , AFATDS 7.0 may be used as a web \napplication(s) (same application(s) used for Web Client end user devices, but with \nthe application(s) hosted locally) or as a native Android application(s).  To minimize the software maintenance burden associated with man aging two  \nseparate AFATDS 7.0 variants, the Government intends to implement AFATDS  \n7.0 as a web application(s) for use both on the Web and Smart Clients.  Should the Contractor find that there is a significant challenge in supporting AFATDS 7.0 as a web ap plication(s) when running on a Smart Client, these concerns will be  \npresented to the Government so alternatives can be discussed and selected . \n\nb. In addition to HTML5 web applications, MCE also allows for application \ndevelopers to implement applications as native Android based applications.  \nDevelopment of AFATDS 7.0 as a native Android application(s) is not a preferred implementation method given portability challenges that may exist with this  \napproach.  \n\nc. If the Contractor finds that circumstances favor impl ementation of all or portions  \nof AFATDS 7.0 as a native Android application(s), these factors will be brought  \nto the attention of the Government for discussion and final decision.  \n\n6.2.6 Subtask 6  Legacy Code Review and Removal  \n\nWith utilization of common  services available from COE being a major emphasis  \narea for AFATDS 7.0, it is expected that certain capabilities within AFATDS may  \nbecome duplicative with COE derived functionality.  Organic functionality that is  \nredundant with capability provided via COE  will be removed from AFATDS 7.0.  \n\n6.2.7 Subtask 7  Data Distribution Service (DDS) Suppor t \n\nAFATDS 7.0 will interface with DDS via the publication and subscription \nservices made available to Web and Smart Clients.  Deltas between DDS  \ncapability found in previous  AFATDS versions and AFATDS 7.0 when using the  \nCOE provided publication/subscription services will be brought to the attention of  \nthe Government for resolution.  \n\n6.2.8 Subtask 8  Messagin g \n\nAll messaging formats and communication methods supported in AFATDS  \n6.8.1.1 will be retained in AFATDS 7.0.  COE common services will be utilized \nas the primary means for meeting all messaging requirements for AFATDS.  \nDeltas will be identified to the Government so that appropriate action can be  \ntaken.

The CM program will establish and maintain consistency of the  \nproduct\u2019s performance, functionality, and attributes with respect to its  \nrequirements.  The CM p rogram will establish and maintain control of all \narchitectures, requirements, specifications, designs, drawings, interfaces,  \nsoftware, hardware, firmware, operational information, and documentation for the  \nproject . \n\nf. The Contractor will submit data in an e lectronic format and post to DI2E to \nsupport effective communication and timely exchange of information to support  \nMission Command CPCE framework efforts.  Only unclassified information will  \nbe allowed in this forum.   \n\n6.2 Task 2  Core Requirement Objectives  \n\n6.2.1 Subtask 1  Support Current/Upgraded/New Weapon Systems and Munitions  \n\na. AFATDS 7.0 will support new munitions variants, to include smart  \nmunitions that will encompass but not be restricted to the following types:  HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  19 of 217 \n\n a) New and/or improved artillery, shell, fuze, propellants; b) New and/or  \nimproved mortar munitions for Army and the Marine Corps EFSS system;  \nand c) New and/or improved Rocket Missile Munitions.  These munitions  \nwill have new ranges, lethality, accuracy, and/or shell/fuze/charge \ncombinations.  T hese updated characteristics will be reflected in the \nappropriate AFATDS 7.0 components as determined by munition type . \n b. AFATDS 7.0 will support upgrades to existing weapon platforms, new  \nweapon platforms or platform variants, to include hosted fire contr ol \nsystems (e.g.  Paladin, M777, MLRS, HIMARS, EFSS, Mortar Systems, \nM119A 3).   \n c. AFATDS 7.0 will accommodate changes in message data to/from  \nplatforms to support new ballistic and non -ballistic trajectory, range, and  \nrate requirements.   \n d. AFATDS 7.0 will s upport the elimination of outdated munitions and \nweapon systems . \n e. AFATDS 7.0 will support enhancement of current behavior that supports  \ncurrent platforms and munitions.  This will include but not be limited to:  multiple precision targets; mixed munitions l oads; mixed weapon types  \nwithin unit; increased message automation (fewer manual Class 3  \nmessages); and longer range communications with platforms . \n\nf. The AFATDS 7.0 r e-architecting and modernization efforts will not in any  \nway result in capability or inter operability loss.  The same capabilities that \ncan be performed by AFATDS 6.8.1.1 today will still be available from  \nthe AFATDS 7.0 system, unless otherwise noted in the AFATDS 7.0 SRS . \n\n6.2.2 Subtask 2-  Capability Retirement and Consolidatio n \n\nAFATDS 7.0 will re tire and consolidate the following:   \n\na. ATLAS  \u2013 ATLAS will no longer be supported as an individual end item  \nwithin the AFATDS product line.  Collaborative functionality previously  \nmade available via ATLAS will be supported within the collaboration \nservices  made available to AFATDS 7.0 . \n\nb. EMT \u2013 EMT will no longer be supported as an individual end item within \nthe AFATDS product line.  The capability previously exposed via EMT  \nwill be found within AFATDS 7.0.   \n\nc. Digital Fire Support Training System (DFSTS)  \u2013 Capabilities will be  \nmerged with the AFATDS 7.0 application.  These functions will be  \nincorporated as part of the embedded training capabilities.   HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  20 of 217 \n\n  \n6.2.3 Subtask 3  Operate in CPCE and Mounted Computing Environment (MCE ) \n\nThe AFATDS 7.0 architecture will be designed to work both within CPCE and \nMCE.  Meeting the needs of both environments will require AFATDS 7.0 to be  \naccessible from both web and smart client devices.  When operating via a Web  \nClient, AFATDS 7.0 will support all versions of ozone and the joint comm and \nand control common user interface that are targeted for COE v3 along with associated browsers.  AFATDS 7.0 will run on supported server infrastructure  \nplanned for hosting COE web applications.  When operating via a Smart Client, AFATDS 7.0 will run on C OE v3 end user device hardware and run within the  \nresource constraints dictated by COE Technical Guidance . \n\n6.2.4 Subtask 4-  Maximize Use of CPCE Services  "

        "7.2 Incentive #2:  Performance ( 0-5% Gateway Incentive ) \nThe contractor is eligible to earn up to 5% fee for delivering an AFATDS 7.0 baseline that opera tionally  \ndemonstrates it meets all baseline requirements as outlined in the AFATDS Software Requirements \nSpecification (SRS) by the end of the CLIN 0001 PoP.  The 5% fee allocated to this incentive is based \nupon the agreed upon target cost and does no t increase/decrease if the contractor realizes a target cost  \nunderrun/overrun.  The fee available for this incentive  will be set at time of awar d based upon the agreed \nupon target cost and available target fee.   \n\nThis incentive is a  Gateway Fee incentive that b uilds off of initial and continued superior performanc e.  \nThe Government will assess performance at defined \u201cGates\u201d (as described below).  If the contractor  \nsuccessfully meets the performance parameters at each Gate, they earn fee.  In addition, if the con tractor  \nsequentiall y meets the performance parameters of Gates 1, 2, and 3, they are eligible to earn a flat fee \nbonus.  If the contractor does not successively pass Gates 1, 2, and 3 they forfeit their opportunity to  \nearn the flat fee bonu s.  Forfeiting t he flat fee bonus for not successively passing Gates 1, 2, and 3  does \nnot impact the contractor\u2019s ability to earn fee at the Final Gate.   \n\nIn alignment with the Statement of Objectives, paragraph, 6.15, the contractor is to deliver engineer  \nreleases starti ng 120 calendar days after contract award and every 60 days thereafter.  It is anticipated  \nthere will be a total of 10 engineering releases and 1 final release throughout the PoP of CLIN 0001.  \n Therefore, the defined Gates for this incentive will focus on a subset of those engineering releases and are \nas stated below:   \nGate 1  - Engineering Release 3   \nGate 2  - Engineering Release 6   \nGate 3  - Engineering Release 9   \nFinal Gate  - AFATDS 7.0 Baseline Release  \n\n Gate 1 (Engineering Release 3), Gate 2 (Engineering Release 6), and Gate 3 (Engineering  \nRelease 9)   \nThe contractor is eligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool for engineering releases 3, 6, and 9  \n(for a total of 30% of the available 5% fee pool i f each gate is achieved successfully).  The contractor is \neligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool at each Gate if the engineering release is delivered to the \nGovernment with n o Priority 1 or 2 errors; no exceptions.  Priority levels are as define d in the AFATDS  \nSRS.  There is no limit on Priority 3 or 4 error rates.  The data used to substantiate this performance  \nassessment will be the contractor\u2019s testing data supplied in the applicable CDRL  A035 \u2013 Software Test  \nDescription.   \n\n Gates 1, 2, and 3 Successively Superior Flat Fee  \nThe contractor is eligible to earn 20% of the available 5% fee pool as a flat fee bonus for successively  \nmeeting Gates 1, 2, and 3, as defined above.  Therefore, if the contractor delivers  all thre e engineering  \nreleases (engineering releases 3, 6, and 9) with  no Priority 1 or 2 errors, they are eligible for the flat fee  \nbonus; no exceptions.  \n\nAs stated under Gates 1, 2, and 3, the priority levels are as defined in the AFATDS SRS.  There is no \nlimit on priority 3 or 4 error rates.  The data used to substantiate this performance assessment will be the \ncontractor\u2019s testing data supplied in the applicable CDRL  A035 \u2013 Software Test Description.   HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  88 of 217 \n\n  \n Final Gat e \nThe contractor is also eligible for 50% of th e available 5% fee pool if the final gate  - AFATDS Baseline  \nRelease meets the baseline requirements outlined in AFATDS SRS.  Contractor compliance with baseline \nrequirements will be monitored by the Government via the documented verification and validation \nmethod for each requirement as outlined in the AFATDS SRS.  The contractor is eligible to earn this fee  \npool whether or not they\u2019ve earned fee at the previous gateway evaluation s.  \n\nBelow is the formula to be utilized:   \n\nAgreed Upon Target Cost  100.00 $                      a\nAvailable Fee  5.00 $                           b\nGate 1 - Engineering Release 3 0.50 $                            b * .1 = c\nGate 2 - Engineering Release 6 0.50 $                            b * .1 = d\nGate 3 - Engineering Release 9 0.50 $                            b * .1 = e\nGate 1-3 Successive Gate Flat Fee Bonu s 1.00 $                           b * .2 = f\nFee Subtotal  2.50 $                           c+d+e+f = g\nFinal Gate - 7.0 Baseline Release  2.50 $                           b * .5 = h\nTotal Fee Earned  5.00 $                           g + h = jPerformance Incentive Calculatio n\n\n*The above table is an example to show calculation/formula, amounts are subject to the agreed upon \ntarget cost.  \n\nNote:  If throughout the course of the contract, the Government approves a request for waiver or request  \nfor deviation on a baseline requirement, the contractor will not be subject to assessment on that  \nrequirement and full fee can continue to be earned v ia this incentive.    \n\n7.3 Incentive #3:  Performance & Schedule (2% Flat Fee Bonus/Disincentive)   \nThis incentive is a Gateway Fee incentive that builds off of Incentive #2, Final Gate.   \n\nThe contractor is  only eligible for this 2% Flat Fee Bonus  if the co ntractor achieves the Final Gate \nunder Incentive # 2, as it is not the Government intention to provide a bonus for providing a software  \nbaseline on time that does not meet baseline requirements.   \n\n Incentive   \nTherefore, if the contractor successfully clear s the Final Gate under Incentive #2 no later than 26 months  \nafter award, the contractor is eligible for a flat fee of 2% of the target cost.  The 2% fee allocated to this  \nincentive is based upon the agreed upon target cost and  does no t increase/decrease if  the contractor  \nrealizes a Target Cost Underrun/Overrun.  The fee available for this incentive will be set at time of awar d \nbased upon the agreed upon target cost and available target fee.   \n  \nDisincentive  \nConversely, if the contractor fails the final gate under Incentive #2  AND does no t deliver the AFATDS  \n7.0 baseline within 26 months of award, the contractor will pay the Government liquidated damages of  \n2% of the target cost.   \n\nIn a situation where the contractor fails the final gate of Incentive #2, but the Government decides to take \nacceptance of the AFATDS 7.0 baseline with known deficiencies  within 26 months of award in order to HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  89 of 217 ",
        " ensure the delivery of some capability to the Army Force, the contractor w ill not be assesse d for \nliquidated damages.  A Government decision to assume greater risk and accept a delinquent AFATDS  \nv7.0 final release does NOT result in the contractor being eligible for fee under the final gate of  \nIncentive #2 .   \n\n7.4 Bonus Pool:  Superior Performance (3% Flat Fee Bonus)   \n\nThe contractor is eligible to earn a 3% flat fee bonus for superior performance on the AFATDS 7.0 CLIN  \n0001.  Superior performance under this incentive is defined as the following ( note, all criteria  below  \nmust be met to earn this bonu s):   \n1) contractor maintains cost control under Incentive #1 thereby maintaining target cost  or realizing a  \ncost underrun (contractor earns 2-5% fee under Incentive #1);   \n2) contractor maintains performance under Incentive #2  thereby successfully meeting the Final Gate \n(contractor earns 2. 5-5% fee under Incentive #2); and  \n3) contractor delivers performance on schedule under Incentive #3 thereby successfully meeting the \nFinal Gate under Incentive #2 no later than 26 months after  contract award.        \n\nThe contractor is eligible to earn this flat fee bonus whether or not they\u2019ve earned fee at gates 1, 2, or 3  \nunder Incentive # 2. \n\nThe contractor is not eligible for this flat fee bonus if the Government makes a  decision to assume \ngreater risk and accept a delinquent AFATDS v7.0 final release under the final gate of Incentive #2 . \n\n \n\n \nATTACHMENT J-4 GFE MATRI X \nAttachment J- 4 \n\nGFE List.xls x\n\n \n\nATTACHMENT J-5 CDRL S \n  \n\nAdvanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) 7. 0 Modernizatio n \nGeneral Instructions for Exhibit CDRL Items (DD Form 1423s ) \n\n \n1.

The security plan should inc lude implementation status, responsible entities, resources, and \nestimated completion dates. Security plans may also include, but are not limited  \nto, a compiled list of system characteristics or qualities required for system registration, key securit y-related documents such as a risk assessment, privacy  \nimpact assessment, system interconnection agreements, contingency plan, security  \nconfigurations, configuration management plan, and incident response plan.   \n\n6.12.2 Subtask 2  Categorize Syste m \nThe Contractor wil l support Step 1 of the RMF, categorize the system.  The  \nsystem has the following RMF Categorization levels:  Confidentiality:  Medium; Integrity:  High; Availability:  High.  The results of the system categorization will be documented in the SSP.  The sys tem categorization is a coordinated effort  \nbetween the Contractor and the Government\u2019s cybersecurity team.   The system  \nwill be described (including system boundary) and documented in the SSP.  The  \nGovernment has the responsibility of registering the syste m in the enterprise  \nMission Assurance Support Service (eMASS).  After the Government registers  HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  37 of 217 \n\n the system in eMASS the Contractor will be responsible for inputting data into the  \neMASS system, as outlined in the following sections . \n\n6.12.3 Subtask 3  Select Securi ty Control s \n\nThe Contractor will support Step 2 of the RMF to select appropriate security  \ncontrols based on the system categorization.  The Contractor will assist the  \nGovernment in the selection of appropriate controls by identification of the  \nsecurity con trol baseline for the system, and documenting these in the SSP.  \nBaseline controls and control overlays will be tailored for the system.  Overlays  \nmay add or subtract security controls, or provide additional guidance regarding  \nsecurity controls, resulting i n a set of security controls applicable to the system  \nthat is a combination of the baseline and overlay.  The combination of baselines  \nand overlays address the unique security protection needs associated with the  \nsystem.  If necessary, control sets will b e tailored (modified) in response to  \nincreased risk from changes in threats or vulnerabilities, or variations in risk  \ntolerance.  Tailoring decisions must be coordinated with the Government, and \naligned with operational considerations and the system environ ment.  Security  \ncontrols will be added or removed only as a function of specified, ris k-based  \ndeterminations.  Tailoring decisions, including the specific rationale (e.g., mapping to risk tolerance) for those decisions, will be documented in the security  \nplan for the system.  A monitoring strategy must be developed and documented as  \na syste m-level strategy for the continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of  \nsecurity controls employed within or inherited by the system, and monitoring of  \nany proposed or ac tual changes to the system and its environment of operation.  \nThe strategy must include the plan for annual assessments of a subset of  \nimplemented security controls, and the level of independence required of the  \nassessor (e.g., Information System Security M anager (ISSM) or Security Control  \nAssessor (SCA)).  The breadth, depth, and rigor of these annual assessments will  \nbe reflective of the security categorization of the system and threats to the system.

The  \nContractor will develop a plan to assess the security controls, known as the  \nSecurity Assessment Plan.  An assessment methodology can be found in NIST  \nSpecial Publication 80 0-53A.  The Contractor will assess the security controls in \naccordance with the security assessment plan and DoD assessment procedures.  Assessment procedures are used to verify that a security control has been properly  \nimplemented.  SRG  and STIG compliance results will be documented and used as  \npart of the overall security control assessment.  This assessment process will be  \nconducted any time there are updates or changes made that would impact the assessments.  Assessments will be recor ded.  If no vulnerabilities are found  \nthrough the process of executing the assessment procedures, the security control is  \nrecorded as compliant.  If vulnerabilities are found, the control is recorded as Not  \nCompliant (NC) in the Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M), with sufficient  \nexplanation.  Vulnerability severity values are assigned to all NC controls by the  \nSCA as part of the security control analysis to indicate the severity associated  \nwith the identified vulnerability.  As part of the overall asses sment prior to  \nauthority to operation, the Government will assign an assessment team.  This team  \nwill be responsible for assessing overall compliance, determination of risk level, \nassessing and characterizing the aggregate level of risk to the system, and \npreparing the security assessment report.  The Contractor will support the ISSM  \nand assessment team in performing this assessment.   \n 6.12.6 Subtask 6  Authorize Syste m \n\nThe Contractor will support Step 5 of RMF, authorize system. The Contractor will  \nassist in the authorization process through review of the POA&M with the ISSM.  \nThe POA&M identifies tasks that need to be accomplished to remediate or  \nmitigate vulnerabilitie s, specifies resources required to accomplish the elements  HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  39 of 217 \n\n of the plan, and includes milestones for completing tasks and their scheduled \ncompletion dates.  The Contractors\u2019 assistance in developing the POA&M is vital  \nto ensuring its maintenance throughout  the system life cycle.  Once posted to the \nPOA&M, vulnerabilities will be updated after correction or mitigation actions are  \ncompleted, but not removed.  The associated trouble report will be documented \nand referenced in the POA&M.  The Government will as semble the security  \nauthorization package for submission to the Authorization Official (AO) for  \nreview and final acceptance.

The 5% fee allocated to this incentive is based \nupon the agreed upon target cost and does no t increase/decrease if the contractor realizes a target cost  \nunderrun/overrun.  The fee available for this incentive  will be set at time of awar d based upon the agreed \nupon target cost and available target fee.   \n\nThis incentive is a  Gateway Fee incentive that b uilds off of initial and continued superior performanc e.  \nThe Government will assess performance at defined \u201cGates\u201d (as described below).  If the contractor  \nsuccessfully meets the performance parameters at each Gate, they earn fee.  In addition, if the con tractor  \nsequentiall y meets the performance parameters of Gates 1, 2, and 3, they are eligible to earn a flat fee \nbonus.  If the contractor does not successively pass Gates 1, 2, and 3 they forfeit their opportunity to  \nearn the flat fee bonu s.

It is anticipated  \nthere will be a total of 10 engineering releases and 1 final release throughout the PoP of CLIN 0001.  \n Therefore, the defined Gates for this incentive will focus on a subset of those engineering releases and are \nas stated below:   \nGate 1  - Engineering Release 3   \nGate 2  - Engineering Release 6   \nGate 3  - Engineering Release 9   \nFinal Gate  - AFATDS 7.0 Baseline Release  \n\n Gate 1 (Engineering Release 3), Gate 2 (Engineering Release 6), and Gate 3 (Engineering  \nRelease 9)   \nThe contractor is eligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool for engineering releases 3, 6, and 9  \n(for a total of 30% of the available 5% fee pool i f each gate is achieved successfully).  The contractor is \neligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool at each Gate if the engineering release is delivered to the \nGovernment with n o Priority 1 or 2 errors; no exceptions.  Priority levels are as define d in the AFATDS  \nSRS.  There is no limit on Priority 3 or 4 error rates.

Concep t:  The purpose of this Incentives Plan is to incentivize superior performance and motivate the \ncontra ctor to successfully complete the overall objectives of this AFATDS 7.0 program while controlling  \ncost, schedule, and risk.  This Incentives Plan is built upon a performance based incentives methodology  \nand is uniquely structured to align incentives with m easurable performance based outcomes.   HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  85 of 217 \n\n  \n5.  Incentives Revisions/Optimization :  As stated above, the methodology behind this Incentives Plan is  \nperformance based incentives/di s-incentives.  Therefore, this plan will be updated as needed throughout  \nthe cont ract Period of Performance (PoP) in order to ensure it continues to effectively incentivize superior  \nperformance and result in a sound business arrangement between all parties.  Any changes to this plan  \nafter contract award will be mutually agreed upon be tween the Government and contractor.   \n\n6.  Incentive Fee Allocatio n.  This Incentives Plan is currently structured to incentivize contractor  \nperformance under the AFATDS Modernization and Development Baseline (CLIN 0001).  The incentives  \nfor AFATDS  Modernization and Development Target (CLIN 0002 ), will be subject to mutual agreement  \nprior to exercising that option with the exceptio n of the Cost Control Incentive.  \n\nAt time of award, the contractor\u2019s target cost and target fee will be agreed upon for  CLIN 0001, the  \ncontractor will be eligible to earn up to 15% fee/bonus pool on the target cost of CLIN 0001.  With the  \nexception of the provision fee listed in paragraph 7.1 for Incentive #1, the Government will perform an \nincentive review prior to paymen t of any fees.  In incentive #2, the Government will review and make a \nfinal determination for the fee earned in performance of engineering releases and provide the results to the  \ncontracting officer.  The contractor will then be notified of the approval t o invoice against the incentive  \nCLIN . \n 7.  Incentives .  This contract will utilize a multiple incentive approach.  Below are the incentives the  \ncontractor is eligible to earn during the PoP of CLIN 0001.  All percentages will be rounded to the nearest  \ntenth. \n\n7.1 Incentive #1:  Cost Control ( 0-5% Incentive)  \nThe Government will assess contractor cost control.  At time of award, a target cost for CLIN 0001, based  \nupon the contractor\u2019s proposal, will be finalized and documented in Section B of the contract.  T he \nfollowing calculation(s) will be utilized to determine fee on cost control performance as related to the  \ntarget cost of CLIN 0001.  \n  \nTarget Cost   \n The contractor will be eligible for 2% fee for meeting target cost.

The contractor is eligible to  lose all fe e set aside for the cost control  \nIncentive if they overrun by 120%, the ceiling of CLIN 0 001.  Below is the formula to be utilized:   \n\n \n\n*The above table is an example to show calculation/formula, amounts are subject to the agreed upon \ntarget cost.  \n\nThe contractor is eligible for provisional fee payments up to 1% of the agreed upon target cost,  \nthroughout the course of CLIN 0001 PoP as long as their Estimate at Complete (EAC), reported in \nContract Data Requirements List (CDRL) A001  \u2013 Integrated Progr am Management Report (IPMR)  \nremains under or equal to the agreed upon target cost.  If the contractor submits CDRL A001 submission  \nthat shows EAC has exceeded the agreed upon target cost all provisional fee payments will be suspended  \nfor the remainder of t he PoP.  Provisional fee payments will not commence until after the Government  \nhas approved the Integrated Baseline Review (IBR).  Once the contractor has held a successful IBR, they  \nwill be able to invoice fee in each voucher.  The amount of fee available for invoicing in each voucher  \nwill be determined by taking the 1% of the agreed upon target cost and dividing it by the total number of  \nNegotiated Target Cost   \n 100.00  \n $                 \n   \n a \n20% Overru n \n 120.00  \n $                 \n   \n b \n0.1% Reduction Threshol d \n 1.00 \n $                      \n   \n (b - a) / 20 = c  \nActual  Cost \n 110.00  \n $                 \n   \n d \nActual Overru n \n 10.00  \n $                    \n   \n d - a = E  \nFee % on Cos t \n 1.00%  \n.02 - (e / c) * .001 = f  \nActual Obligatio n \n 111.00  \n $                 \n   \n a *(1+ f )+ e  \nOverrun Cost Calculatio n HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  87 of 217 \n\n remaining invoices to be submitted throughout the PoP of CLIN 0001.

When operating on a Smart Client , AFATDS 7.0 may be used as a web \napplication(s) (same application(s) used for Web Client end user devices, but with \nthe application(s) hosted locally) or as a native Android application(s).  To minimize the software maintenance burden associated with man aging two  \nseparate AFATDS 7.0 variants, the Government intends to implement AFATDS  \n7.0 as a web application(s) for use both on the Web and Smart Clients.  Should the Contractor find that there is a significant challenge in supporting AFATDS 7.0 as a web ap plication(s) when running on a Smart Client, these concerns will be  \npresented to the Government so alternatives can be discussed and selected . \n\nb. In addition to HTML5 web applications, MCE also allows for application \ndevelopers to implement applications as native Android based applications.  \nDevelopment of AFATDS 7.0 as a native Android application(s) is not a preferred implementation method given portability challenges that may exist with this  \napproach.  \n\nc. If the Contractor finds that circumstances favor impl ementation of all or portions  \nof AFATDS 7.0 as a native Android application(s), these factors will be brought  \nto the attention of the Government for discussion and final decision.  \n\n6.2.6 Subtask 6  Legacy Code Review and Removal  \n\nWith utilization of common  services available from COE being a major emphasis  \narea for AFATDS 7.0, it is expected that certain capabilities within AFATDS may  \nbecome duplicative with COE derived functionality.  Organic functionality that is  \nredundant with capability provided via COE  will be removed from AFATDS 7.0.  \n\n6.2.7 Subtask 7  Data Distribution Service (DDS) Suppor t \n\nAFATDS 7.0 will interface with DDS via the publication and subscription \nservices made available to Web and Smart Clients.  Deltas between DDS  \ncapability found in previous  AFATDS versions and AFATDS 7.0 when using the  \nCOE provided publication/subscription services will be brought to the attention of  \nthe Government for resolution.  \n\n6.2.8 Subtask 8  Messagin g \n\nAll messaging formats and communication methods supported in AFATDS  \n6.8.1.1 will be retained in AFATDS 7.0.  COE common services will be utilized \nas the primary means for meeting all messaging requirements for AFATDS.  \nDeltas will be identified to the Government so that appropriate action can be  \ntaken.  It remains possible tha t capability deltas may need to be filled via  HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  22 of 217 \n\n development actions performed by the AFATDS 7.0 developer working in \ncoordination with the primary service developer.  \n\n6.2.9 Subtask 9  External Interface Requirement s ",
        "e. The Contractor will maintain a Configuration Management (CM) program visible  \non DI2E.  The CM program will establish and maintain consistency of the  \nproduct\u2019s performance, functionality, and attributes with respect to its  \nrequirements.  The CM p rogram will establish and maintain control of all \narchitectures, requirements, specifications, designs, drawings, interfaces,  \nsoftware, hardware, firmware, operational information, and documentation for the  \nproject . \n\nf. The Contractor will submit data in an e lectronic format and post to DI2E to \nsupport effective communication and timely exchange of information to support  \nMission Command CPCE framework efforts.  Only unclassified information will  \nbe allowed in this forum.   \n\n6.2 Task 2  Core Requirement Objectives  \n\n6.2.1 Subtask 1  Support Current/Upgraded/New Weapon Systems and Munitions  \n\na. AFATDS 7.0 will support new munitions variants, to include smart  \nmunitions that will encompass but not be restricted to the following types:  HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  19 of 217 \n\n a) New and/or improved artillery, shell, fuze, propellants; b) New and/or  \nimproved mortar munitions for Army and the Marine Corps EFSS system;  \nand c) New and/or improved Rocket Missile Munitions.  These munitions  \nwill have new ranges, lethality, accuracy, and/or shell/fuze/charge \ncombinations.  T hese updated characteristics will be reflected in the \nappropriate AFATDS 7.0 components as determined by munition type . \n b. AFATDS 7.0 will support upgrades to existing weapon platforms, new  \nweapon platforms or platform variants, to include hosted fire contr ol \nsystems (e.g.  Paladin, M777, MLRS, HIMARS, EFSS, Mortar Systems, \nM119A 3).   \n c. AFATDS 7.0 will accommodate changes in message data to/from  \nplatforms to support new ballistic and non -ballistic trajectory, range, and  \nrate requirements.   \n d. AFATDS 7.0 will s upport the elimination of outdated munitions and \nweapon systems . \n e. AFATDS 7.0 will support enhancement of current behavior that supports  \ncurrent platforms and munitions.  This will include but not be limited to:  multiple precision targets; mixed munitions l oads; mixed weapon types  \nwithin unit; increased message automation (fewer manual Class 3  \nmessages); and longer range communications with platforms . \n\nf. The AFATDS 7.0 r e-architecting and modernization efforts will not in any  \nway result in capability or inter operability loss.  The same capabilities that \ncan be performed by AFATDS 6.8.1.1 today will still be available from  \nthe AFATDS 7.0 system, unless otherwise noted in the AFATDS 7.0 SRS . \n\n6.2.2 Subtask 2-  Capability Retirement and Consolidatio n \n\nAFATDS 7.0 will re tire and consolidate the following:   \n\na. ATLAS  \u2013 ATLAS will no longer be supported as an individual end item  \nwithin the AFATDS product line.  Collaborative functionality previously  \nmade available via ATLAS will be supported within the collaboration \nservices  made available to AFATDS 7.0 . \n\nb. EMT \u2013 EMT will no longer be supported as an individual end item within \nthe AFATDS product line.  The capability previously exposed via EMT  \nwill be found within AFATDS 7.0.   \n\nc. Digital Fire Support Training System (DFSTS)  \u2013 Capabilities will be  \nmerged with the AFATDS 7.0 application.  These functions will be  \nincorporated as part of the embedded training capabilities.

        "5.1 General  \nEach offeror shall submit a past performance volume with its proposal, containing past  \nperformance information in accordance with the format contained in the Past and Present  \nPerformance Information.  Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use da ta provided by  \neach offeror in this volume and data obtained from other sources in the evaluation of past  \nperformance. Along with the information required in this paragraph, the offeror shall submit a  \nconsent letter executed by each subcontractor, teaming partner, and/or joint venture partner, HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  181 of 217 \n\n authorizing release of past performance information to the offeror so the offeror can respond to  \nsuch information.  \n\n5.2 Volume III Organization  \nThe Past Performance volume shall be organized according to the followin g general outline : \n\nPart A  \u2013 Summary of Relevant Past Performance Contracts describing the role of the offeror and \neach teaming partner, joint venture partner, and/or significant subcontractor that the offeror is  \nrequired to provide Past Performance Inform ation Sheets (Ref:  HC1028 -16-R-0005, Section L, \nAttachment L-1). \n Part B  - Subcontractor/Teaming Partner Consent Letters executed by each teaming partner, joint  \nventure partner and/or significant subcontractors authorizing the release of past performance  \ninformation so the offeror can respond to such information.  A sample consent letter is provided at  \nHC1028 -16-R-0005, Section L, Attachment L-4. \n Part C  - Client Authorization Letters for each identified effort for a commercial customer  \nauthorizing release to the Government of requested information on the offeror\u2019s performance.  See  \nHC1028 -16-R-0005, Section L Attachment L-5 for Client Authorization Letters . \n\n5.3 Relevant Contract s \n\na. Submit information using the format contained in Attachment L-1, Past an d Present Performance \nInformation:  Past Performance Information on no more than three recent (active within the past five years from the original issue date of this solicitation) contracts,  this may include significant  \nteaming partner\u2019s and/or significant  subcontractor\u2019s past performance information submissions , \nthat you consider most relevant in demonstrating you and your significant teaming partner\u2019s and/or  \nsignificant subcontractor\u2019s ability to perform the proposed effort .  The information submitted sh all \nreference only the offeror\u2019s, significant teaming partner\u2019s, or significant subcontractor\u2019s past  \nperformance on the submitted effort, rather than the past performance of other contractors on the  \nsubmitted effort.   \n b.  In addition, the prime offeror s hall include information on a minimum of one recent contract  \nperformed by the prime offeror that you consider most relevant in demonstrating your ability to \nperform the proposed effort. Please see the maximum limitations set forth in subparagraph d \nbelow . \n c.\n  Recent contracts are considered to be efforts that the prime offeror and its teaming partners,  \njoint venture or significant subcontractors have performed within the past five years prior to original  issuance of the solicitation, or for ongoing efforts  the period of performance of which must  \nhave started at least nine months before the original proposal due date . \n d.  The total of Past and Present Performance Information references will not exceed three pages  \nper reference.  Total page count for this Pa st Performance volume is annotated above in Table 2 -2.  \nInclude rationale supporting your assertion of relevance.  The Government  uses degree s \nof \nrelevanc y when assessin g recent , relevan t contracts in accordance wit h DoD Sourc e Selectio n HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  182 of 217 \n\n Procedures , paragraph  3.1.3.1,  Table 4, exerted in Section M as Table 3, Past Performance \nRelevancy Ratings.  The past performance evaluation team will consider the performance \nquality of relevant recent efforts for the second aspect of the past performance evaluatio n using  \nSection M Table 4, Past Performance Quality Assessment.  Finally, the past performance \nevaluation team will review this past performance information and determine the quality as it applies to performance confidence assessment.  Performance Confiden ce Assessment ratings are \nidentified in Section M, Table 5.  \n\n5.3.1 Specific Content   \nOfferors are required to explain what aspects of the submitted past performance efforts are deemed  \nrelevant to the proposed effort and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate.  This may  \ninclude a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior  \ncontracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk.  Merely having problems does  \nnot automatically equate  to a limited or no confidence rating because the problems encountered may  \nhave been on a more complex program, or an offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the  \nability to overcome the problems encountered.  The offeror is required to clearly demonstra te \nmanagement actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions in terms of  \nimprovements achieved or problems rectified.  Categorize the relevant information into the specific  \ntechnical/management subfactors used to evaluate the prop osal. \n\n5.3.2 Organizational Structure Change History   \nMany companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc.  In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or  \nbetween conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection.  As a result, it is sometimes  \ndifficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this procurement.  To f acilitate this  \nrelevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a \"roadmap\" describing all such changes in the organization of your company.  A pamphlet or other commercial document  \ndescribing such reorganizations may suffice.  As part of this expl anation, show how these  \nchanges impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/confidence assessment.  Since the Government intends to consider past performance  \ninformation provided by other sources as well as that provide d by the offerors, your \"roadmap\"  \nshould be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources . \n 5.4 Questionnaire s \nThe offeror shall provide the Sample Questionnaire Cover Letter and Past Performance  \nQuestionnaire, found at HC1028 -16-R-0005, Section L, Attachments L-2 and L -3 respectively,  \nto each of the customer POCs identified for each of the submitted past performa nce efforts.  In  \norder to expedite the assessment process, the offeror shall complete Sections I, II and III of the  \nPast Performance Questionnaire for the convenience of the POC.  The offeror shall not, however, complete any other section of the Past Perfo rmance Questionnaire.  Once the questionnaires are  \ncompleted by the POCs, the information contained therein shall be considered sensitive and shall  \nnot be released to the offeror.  Early submission of questionnaires is encouraged.  Questionnaires  \nshall be s ent directly to DITCO at  karen.m.kinzel2.civ@mail.mi l and \ndustie.m.thompson.civ@mail.mi l, no later than the due date stated in the RFP.    HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  183 of 217 \n\n  \n6.0 Volum e IV - Cost/Price (Evaluation Factor 5)  \nThe offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated, using one or more of the techniques defined \nin FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is reasonable and complete; a color rating is not  \nassigned to the cost/price  factor.  Normally, price reasonableness is established through cost and  \nprice analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.  The Government will determine  \ncompleteness of the offeror's proposal by verifying that all solicitation requirements have been  \npriced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs are presented in a clear and useful format.  The \nGovernment will evaluate offerors' proposed costs for reasonableness, completeness, affordability and realism.   \n\n6.1 General Instructions   \n\n6.1.1 Cost  Reasonableness, Realism, and Completeness   \nThis section is to assist you in submitting cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the  \nreasonableness, completeness, realism, balance, and/or affordability of your proposed cost.  The  \nGovernment will v erify that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly  \ncalculated, and prices are presented in a clear and useful format.  Note that unrealistically low or  \nhigh proposed costs, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for elimina ting a proposal from  \ncompetition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has  \nsubmitted an unrealistic proposal.  Additionally, unbalanced costs pose an unacceptable risk to \nthe Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror\u2019s proposal.  Cost submissions should be  \nsufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness and be adequate enough to support and sustain a DCAA audit.  \n\n6.1.2 Cost/Price Information  \nInformation beyond that required by this instruction shall  not be submitted, unless you consider  \nit essential to document or support your cost/price position.  All information relating to the  \nproposed price, including all required supporting documentation must be included in the section \nof the proposal designated as the Cost/Price Volume.  Under no circumstances shall this  \ninformation and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal . \n\nLabor and overhead rates should include sufficient detail to sustain a DCAA audit (e.g., direct  \nlabor rates, overhead, fring e benefits, General and Administrative Expense (G&A), fee, etc.).   \n The offeror must provide the basis of estimate for all rates with detailed rationale to support the  \nrates.  For indirect rates, the preferred method for providing support detail is throug h the \nsubmission of a Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) or Forward Pricing Rate  \nRecommendation (FPRR).  However, in the absence of a FPRA/FPRR, the Government will  \naccept all rates and factors by year utilized in the development of the Forward Pricing R ate \nProposal and the basis for these rates and factors (e.g., breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data).  If the contractor is not required to maintain forward pricing rates then the Government will  \naccept other methods of validation.  These methods include  approved provisional billing rates, \nother submitted/approved rates, or the submission of proposed rate calculations (including the  \npools & bases) and the basis of all calculations (e.g., breakdowns, trends, and budgetary data).  The offeror shall state if  rates have been provided to the cognizant Administrative Contracting  HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  184 of 217 \n\n Officer /DCAA office for review or negotiation; if rates have not been submitted, explanation is  \nrequired.

        "If a subcontractor relationship exists, subcontract costs must also be deline ated in accordance \nwith the requirements above.  If needed, the subcontract may submit its unsanitized cost breakout  \ndirectly to the Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer.  The subcontractor shall also provide  \ncontact information for its cognizant DCAA o ffice.   \n\n6.1.3 Cost or Pricing Information Requirement s \n\nIn accordance with  FAR 15.403 -1(b) and 15.403 -3(a), data other than certified cost or pricing  \ndata may be required to support cos t reasonableness.  Information shall be provided in \naccordance with  FAR 15.403 -5.  If, after r eceipt of proposals, the contracting officer determines  \nthe required conditions of adequate competition do not exist that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in  FAR 15.403 -1 apply, \nthe offeror may be required to certify its submitted cost or pricing data . \n\n6.2 Volume Organization  \n\nThe Cost/Price volume shall consist of the following sections : \n\nPart A -Introductio n  \nTable of Contents; summary descriptions of estimating, purchasing, and accounting systems;  \nchanges to estimating, accounting practices, or Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) d isclosure  \nstatement . \n Part B -Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet s  \nCost or pricing information and supporting data, to include estimating methodology . \n\nPart C - Other informatio n \nSuch as GFE, DCAA information, long lead costs, termination costs, development/production \nschedule, inflation rate summary and explanation, life cycle cost, and special tooling/test  \nequipment.  List each exception to the ground rules and assumptions provided in the solicitation and each qualification of the Cost/Price vol ume, if any.  Provide complete rationale for any  \nexceptions . \n 6.3 Part A -Introductio n \n  \n6.3.1 Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms.   \nIf necessary, provide a glossary of abbreviations and acronyms used with an explanation for  \neach. Glossaries do not  count against the page limitations for their respective volumes . \n\n6.3.2 Estimating Syste m \nProvide a summary description of your standard estimating system or methods. The summary  \ndescription shall cover separately each major cost element (e.g., direct mat erial, engineering  \nlabor, manufacturing labor, indirect costs, ODC, overhead, G&A, etc.).  Also, identify any  HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  185 of 217 \n\n deviations from your standard estimating procedures in preparing this proposal volume.

The security plan should inc lude implementation status, responsible entities, resources, and \nestimated completion dates. Security plans may also include, but are not limited  \nto, a compiled list of system characteristics or qualities required for system registration, key securit y-related documents such as a risk assessment, privacy  \nimpact assessment, system interconnection agreements, contingency plan, security  \nconfigurations, configuration management plan, and incident response plan.   \n\n6.12.2 Subtask 2  Categorize Syste m \nThe Contractor wil l support Step 1 of the RMF, categorize the system.  The  \nsystem has the following RMF Categorization levels:  Confidentiality:  Medium; Integrity:  High; Availability:  High.  The results of the system categorization will be documented in the SSP.  The sys tem categorization is a coordinated effort  \nbetween the Contractor and the Government\u2019s cybersecurity team.   The system  \nwill be described (including system boundary) and documented in the SSP.  The  \nGovernment has the responsibility of registering the syste m in the enterprise  \nMission Assurance Support Service (eMASS).

The Contractor will assist the  \nGovernment in the selection of appropriate controls by identification of the  \nsecurity con trol baseline for the system, and documenting these in the SSP.  \nBaseline controls and control overlays will be tailored for the system.  Overlays  \nmay add or subtract security controls, or provide additional guidance regarding  \nsecurity controls, resulting i n a set of security controls applicable to the system  \nthat is a combination of the baseline and overlay.  The combination of baselines  \nand overlays address the unique security protection needs associated with the  \nsystem.  If necessary, control sets will b e tailored (modified) in response to  \nincreased risk from changes in threats or vulnerabilities, or variations in risk  \ntolerance.  Tailoring decisions must be coordinated with the Government, and \naligned with operational considerations and the system environ ment.  Security  \ncontrols will be added or removed only as a function of specified, ris k-based  \ndeterminations.  Tailoring decisions, including the specific rationale (e.g., mapping to risk tolerance) for those decisions, will be documented in the security  \nplan for the system.  A monitoring strategy must be developed and documented as  \na syste m-level strategy for the continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of  \nsecurity controls employed within or inherited by the system, and monitoring of  \nany proposed or ac tual changes to the system and its environment of operation.  \nThe strategy must include the plan for annual assessments of a subset of  \nimplemented security controls, and the level of independence required of the  \nassessor (e.g., Information System Security M anager (ISSM) or Security Control  \nAssessor (SCA)).  The breadth, depth, and rigor of these annual assessments will  \nbe reflective of the security categorization of the system and threats to the system.  Delivery of the security control selection will consis t of input into the eMASS  \nsystem on SIPRNET . \n\n6.12.4 Subtask 4  Implement Security Control s \n\nThe Contractor will support Step 3 of RMF, implementation of security controls.  \nThe system (including applications) will be configured in accordance with \napplicable Secu rity Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) which are \ncoordinated with the Government ISSM and SCA.

The Contractor will suppor t the \nimplementation of security controls for the system.  The Contractor will  \nparticipate in CCB and other meetings to coordinate for implementation of  \nsecurity controls.  Security control requirements will be documented as a trouble  \nreport for tracking o f implementation.  These will be prioritized by the CCB.  The  \nDISA SRG/STIG Collection Tool will be used to document applicable  \ndocuments.  In addition, each control will be documented with the applicable  \ntrouble report identifier in eMASS.   \n\n6.12.5 Subtask 5  A ssess Security Control s \n\nThe Contractor will support Step 4 of RMF, security control assessment.  The  \nContractor will develop a plan to assess the security controls, known as the  \nSecurity Assessment Plan.  An assessment methodology can be found in NIST  \nSpecial Publication 80 0-53A.  The Contractor will assess the security controls in \naccordance with the security assessment plan and DoD assessment procedures.  Assessment procedures are used to verify that a security control has been properly  \nimplemented.  SRG  and STIG compliance results will be documented and used as  \npart of the overall security control assessment.  This assessment process will be  \nconducted any time there are updates or changes made that would impact the assessments.  Assessments will be recor ded.  If no vulnerabilities are found  \nthrough the process of executing the assessment procedures, the security control is  \nrecorded as compliant.  If vulnerabilities are found, the control is recorded as Not  \nCompliant (NC) in the Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M), with sufficient  \nexplanation.  Vulnerability severity values are assigned to all NC controls by the  \nSCA as part of the security control analysis to indicate the severity associated  \nwith the identified vulnerability.  As part of the overall asses sment prior to  \nauthority to operation, the Government will assign an assessment team.  This team  \nwill be responsible for assessing overall compliance, determination of risk level, \nassessing and characterizing the aggregate level of risk to the system, and \npreparing the security assessment report.  The Contractor will support the ISSM  \nand assessment team in performing this assessment.   \n 6.12.6 Subtask 6  Authorize Syste m \n\nThe Contractor will support Step 5 of RMF, authorize system.

The Contractors\u2019 assistance in developing the POA&M is vital  \nto ensuring its maintenance throughout  the system life cycle.  Once posted to the \nPOA&M, vulnerabilities will be updated after correction or mitigation actions are  \ncompleted, but not removed.  The associated trouble report will be documented \nand referenced in the POA&M.

The Government requires  all non- commercial  software and software documentation \nprovided under the AFATDS contract be furnished to the Government with unlimited \nrights and become the property of the Government at completion of the contract .  Note  \nthat integration of COTS software shall not be considered contractor development of  \nsoftware at private expense.  Any exception to this must be addressed in the contractor\u2019s  \nproposal.  Contractors shall obtain the Government\u2019s approval  of non -free a nd open \nsource (non -FOSS ) and COTS items prior to their incorporation.  \n\nd. The Government requires all materials (hardware, manuals, documentation, consumables, \netc.) provided under this contract to become the property of the Government at  \ncompletion of the c ontract . \n\ne. Software and all other materials that shall become the property of the Government, as  \nstated above, at completion of the contract will be listed in the contractor\u2019sproposal . \n\nH.3 RELEASE OF NEWS INFORMATIO N \n\nNo news release (including photographs and films, public announcements, denial or  \nconfirmation of same) on any part of the subject matter of this contract or any phase of  \nany program hereunder shall be made without the prior written approval of the  \nContra cting Officer and DISA Public Affairs Office (PAO), and if Congressionall y-\nrelated, DISA Congressional Affairs (CA).  See also Section I, DFARS clause 252.204 7000 \u201cDisclosure of Information\u201d.  \n\nH.4 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT  \n\na. The COR will evaluate and docum ent the contractor\u2019s performance on an annual basis in \na web- based Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) (or  \nsimilar).  The COR will forward the rating of contractor\u2019s performance to the Assessing  \nOfficial for approval.  The Assessing  Official then forwards the rating to the Contracting  \nOfficer, who will forward it to the contractor for review.  The contractor may not change  \nthe rating.  The contractor shall either concur, concur with comments, or not concur with \ncomments, and return t he evaluation to the Contracting Officer within 30 calendar days . \n HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  68 of 217 \n\n b. Past performance information is relevant information regarding the contractor\u2019s actions  \nunder previously awarded contracts.  The written performance evaluation will state  \nwhether the service s/supplies met the Government\u2019s stated requirements and  \nspecifications and if they were performed/delivered on time.  It includes, for example, the  \ncontractor\u2019s record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good \nworkmanship; the contra ctor\u2019s adherence to contract schedules, including the  \nadministrative aspects of performance; the contractor\u2019s history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the  \ncontractor\u2019s busines s-like concern for t he interest of the customer.  This evaluation may  \nbe either printed or electronic format, as defined by the Government . \n\nc. The evaluation of the contractor\u2019s performance will be used as a criterion for  \nexercising any unexercised option.  The evaluation will  also be used by DISA and \nother Government agencies as source selection information to support future  \nGovernment procurements . \n\nH.5 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI)/OCI MITIGATION PLA N \n\na. An organizational conflict of interest means that because of othe r activities or  \nrelationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render  \nimpartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a perso n has an  \nunfair competitive advantage.  The Government seeks to acquire unbiased advi ce \nand/or goods and services from offerors/contractors that are free from, or have  \nmitigated, Organizational Conflicts of Interest , as defined in FAR 2.101, relating to this contract . \n\nb. In order for the Government to try to prevent an OCI relating to this contract, the  \nparties  to this contract agree that the contractor\u2019s future contracting with the  \nGovernment may be restricted as outlined in FAR Subpart 9.5, if the  \nofferor/ contractor and DISA are unable to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate actual or  \npotential OCI before contract award . ",
        "c. DISA will not automatically exclude a vendor from a competitive acquisition due to  \nan actual or potential OCI.  The Contracting Office is comm itted to working with  \npotential vendors to eliminate or mitigate actual and potential OCI situations, without detriment to the integrity of the competitive process, the DISA mission, or the  \nlegitimate business interests of the vendor community . \n\nd. If the off eror or contractor is aware, or should have been aware, of an OCI before  \naward of this contract or any task under against the contract, and does not fully  \ndisclose that conflict to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the  \ncontractor for de fault. \n HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  69 of 217 \n\n e. The offeror or contractor, by submitting an offer and/or signing the contract, warrants  \nthat it is  not now aware of any actual or potential OCI relating to this contract . \n\nf. After contract award, the contractor shall have an ongoing obligation to make  \u201ca \nprompt and full disclosure\u201d to the Contracting Officer of any OCI that arises during  \nthe performance of the contract, as well as newly discovered conflicts that existed  \nbefore contract award . \n\ng. The OCI Mitigation Plan shall become part of the resultant contract and the  \ncontractor shall update its OCI Mitigation Plan within 30 days of any changes to the  \nlegal construct of the organization, subcontractor changes, or significant management  \nor ownership changes that would result in an actual or potential OC I under this  \ncontract . \n\nH.6 52.237- 9001 Enterpris e-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application  \n(eCMRA) Reporting.   \n\nENTERPRIS E-WIDE CONTRACTOR MANPOWER REPORTING APPLICATION (eCMRA)  \nREPORTING (JAN 2015 ) \n The contractor shall ensure ALL contractor labor hours including subcontractor, at all  \nlevels/tiers, labor hours required for the performance of services provided under this contract are  \nreported via a secure data collection site.   \n The contractor and all  subcontractors, at all levels/tiers, providing direct labor under this contract  \nshall report complete and accurate data for the labor executed during the period of performance during each Government fiscal year (FY), which runs from October 1 to September  30.

The best value determination will be based on the stated \nevaluation factors.   \n The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussion s with  \nofferors.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions or seek \nclarifications if the contracting officer determines they are necessary.  In the event issues  \npertaining to a proposed contract cannot be resolved to the contracti ng officer\u2019s satisfaction, the \nGovernment reserves the right to withdraw and cancel the  solicitation.  In such event, offerors  \nwill be notified in writing.  In the event a competitive range is established and the contracting  \nofficer determines that the nu mber of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range  \nexceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the contracting officer  \nmay limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will \npermit an efficient competition . \n\n c. Evaluation of Option s  \n  \nThe Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options  \nto the total price for the base period.

The pricing proposal should include a separate line item for the  \nadditional si x-month extension period IAW FAR 52.217 -8. The pricing for the additional si x-\nmonth extension period, IAW FAR 52.217 -8, applies to the Engineering Support Services and \nODC CLINs only. These prices shall be identical to the proposed pricing in the six months prior  \nto expiration of the base period, or the final option period, if option periods are present.  The  \ntotal evaluate d price will consist of the contractor\u2019s proposed price for the base period, all option \nperiods, and the option pricing for the additional si x-month extension period.  The Government  \nmay determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are sign ificantly unbalanced.  \nEvaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.   \n\n d. Number of Contracts to be Awarde d \n\nThe Government intends to award one contract for the AFATDS 7.0 Modernization Program;  \nhowever, the Government  reserves the right to make no award at all . \n\n e. Rejection of Offers   \n\nThe Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program  \ncommitments, contract terms and conditions.  Additionally, the Government may reject  \nproposals that are unrealistically high or low in cost when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program . \n  \nM002 EVALUATION FA CTOR S \n\na.

The Government seeks to acquire unbiased advi ce \nand/or goods and services from offerors/contractors that are free from, or have  \nmitigated, Organizational Conflicts of Interest , as defined in FAR 2.101, relating to this contract . \n\nb. In order for the Government to try to prevent an OCI relating to this contract, the  \nparties  to this contract agree that the contractor\u2019s future contracting with the  \nGovernment may be restricted as outlined in FAR Subpart 9.5, if the  \nofferor/ contractor and DISA are unable to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate actual or  \npotential OCI before contract award . ",
        "c. DISA will not automatically exclude a vendor from a competitive acquisition due to  \nan actual or potential OCI.  The Contracting Office is comm itted to working with  \npotential vendors to eliminate or mitigate actual and potential OCI situations, without detriment to the integrity of the competitive process, the DISA mission, or the  \nlegitimate business interests of the vendor community . \n\nd. If the off eror or contractor is aware, or should have been aware, of an OCI before  \naward of this contract or any task under against the contract, and does not fully  \ndisclose that conflict to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the  \ncontractor for de fault. \n HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  69 of 217 \n\n e. The offeror or contractor, by submitting an offer and/or signing the contract, warrants  \nthat it is  not now aware of any actual or potential OCI relating to this contract . \n\nf.

Past Performance Facto r \n\nThe technical/management approach factor is more important than the past performance factor.  In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  The past per formance evaluation factor  \nassesses the degree of confidence the Government has in an offeror\u2019s ability to supply products  \nand services that meet users\u2019 needs, based on a demonstrated record of performance.  Performance confidence is assessed at the overal l past performance factor level after evaluating  \naspects of the offeror\u2019s recent past performance.  The information submitted shall reference only  \nthe offeror\u2019s, significant teaming partner\u2019s, or significant subcontractor\u2019s past performance on \nthe submitte d effort, rather than the past performance of other contractors on the submitted \neffort.   \n\nPast performance information shall be obtained from any other sources available to the  \nGovernment, to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information R etrieval System  \n(PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System, Electronic Subcontract Reporting System, or other databases; interviews with program managers, contracting officers, and fee determining officials; and the Defense Cont ract Management  \nAgency.  \n\n (1) Recency Assessmen t \nAn assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  Recent contracts are considered to be efforts that the prime offeror and its teaming partners, joint  \nventure or s ignificant subcontractors have performed within the past five years prior to original  \nissuance of the solicitation, or for ongoing efforts the period of performance of which must have  \nstarted at least nine months before the original proposal due date.  Pa st performance information  \nthat fails this condition will not be further evaluate d.      \n\n (2) Relevancy Assessmen t \nThe Government will conduct an i n-depth evaluation of all recent performance information \nobtained.  For each recent past performance reference reviewed, the relevance of the work  HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  213 of 217 \n\n performed will generally be assessed as compared to the technical/management factor.  A  \nrelevancy determination of the offeror\u2019s past performance will be made based upon the  \ncontractor\u2019s previous experience in taking an existing DoD Tactical Information system and  \nmodernizing it to a servic e-oriented architecture and/or implemented Android or HTML5 tactical  \napplications.  The past performance information forms and information obtained from other  \nsources will be  used to establish the degree of relevancy of past performance.  The Government  \nwill use the following degrees of relevancy when assessing recent, relevant contracts  \n(Department of Defense (DoD) Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.1) . \n\nTable 3.  Past Performance Relevancy Rating s \nRatin g Definitio n \nVERY RELEVANT   Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same \nscope and magnitude of effort and complexities this  \nsolicitation requires.   \nRELEVANT   Present/past performance effort  involved similar scope and \nmagnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation  \nrequires . \nSOMEWHAT RELEVANT   Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope  \nand magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation  \nrequires.   \nNOT RELEVANT   Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the  \nscope and magnitude of effort and complexities this  \nsolicitation requires . \n\n  (3) Performance Quality Assessment (How well the contractor performed on the  \ncontract. ) \n\nThe Government will consider the performance quality of recent and relevant efforts.  For each \nrecent and relevant past performance reference reviewed, the performance quality of the work  \nperformed will be assessed.  The quality assessment consists of an i n-depth evaluation of the past  \nperformance questionnaire responses, PPIRS information, interviews with Government  \ncustomers, and if applicable, commercial clients.  It may include interviews with Defense  \nContract Management Agency officials or other sourc es known to the Government.   \n\nThe Government will use the following quality ratings when assessing quality of relevant  \ncontracts (DISA Supplemental Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.1 ( S-90)). \n\nTable 4.

The contractual performance of  \nthe element or su b-element being assessed was accomplished  \nwith few minor problems for which corrective actions taken \nby the contractor were highly effective.  \nVERY GOOD (VG)/PURPL E \n During the contract period, contractor performance meets or  \nmet contractual r equirements and exceeds or exceeded some \nto the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of  \nthe element or su b-element being assessed was accomplished  \nwith some minor problems for which corrective actions  \ntaken by the contractor were effective.  \nSATISFACTORY (S)/GREE N \n During the contract period, contractor performance meets or  \nmet contractual requirements. The contractual performance \nof the element or su b-element being assessed contained some \nminor problems for which corrective actions taken by t he \ncontractor appear or were satisfactory . \nMARGINAL (M)/YELLO W \n During the contract period, contractor performance does not  \nor did not meet some contractual requirements. The  \ncontractual performance of the element or su b-element being  \nassessed reflects a  serious problem for which the contractor  \nhas not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's  \nproposed actions appear only marginally effective or were  \nnot fully implemented . \nUNSATISFACTORY(U)/RE D \n During the contract period, contractor performanc e does not  \nor did not meet most contractual requirements and recovery  \nin a timely manner is not likely. The contractual performance  \nof the element or su b-element contains serious problem(s)  \nfor which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were  \nineff ective . \nNOT APPLICABLE (N)/WHIT E Unable to provide a rating.  Contract did not include  \nperformance for this aspect.  Do not know . \n   (4) Assigning Performance Confidence Assessment.  As a result of the relevancy  \nand quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an integrated  \nperformance confidence assessment rating.  The resulting performance confidence as sessment  \nrating is made at the past performance factor level and represents an overall evaluation of  \ncontractor performance.  Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom  \ninformation on past performance is not available will not be e valuated favorably or unfavorably  \non past performance and, as a result, will receive an \"Unknown Confidence\" rating for the past  \nperformance factor.   \n The past performance factor will receive one of the performance confidence assessments  \ndescribed in the D oD Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.3.\n  \n HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  215 of 217 \n\n  d.

The \ntargets submitted in accordance with  FAR 52.219- 24, and Section L paragraph 7.2.4 will be  \nincorporated into and become part of  the contract .  The successful offeror will be required to \nprovide reports on small business subcontractor participation in accordance with FAR 52.219 -25 \nin Section I of th e contract . "

        "7.2 Incentive #2:  Performance ( 0-5% Gateway Incentive ) \nThe contractor is eligible to earn up to 5% fee for delivering an AFATDS 7.0 baseline that opera tionally  \ndemonstrates it meets all baseline requirements as outlined in the AFATDS Software Requirements \nSpecification (SRS) by the end of the CLIN 0001 PoP.  The 5% fee allocated to this incentive is based \nupon the agreed upon target cost and does no t increase/decrease if the contractor realizes a target cost  \nunderrun/overrun.  The fee available for this incentive  will be set at time of awar d based upon the agreed \nupon target cost and available target fee.   \n\nThis incentive is a  Gateway Fee incentive that b uilds off of initial and continued superior performanc e.  \nThe Government will assess performance at defined \u201cGates\u201d (as described below).  If the contractor  \nsuccessfully meets the performance parameters at each Gate, they earn fee.  In addition, if the con tractor  \nsequentiall y meets the performance parameters of Gates 1, 2, and 3, they are eligible to earn a flat fee \nbonus.  If the contractor does not successively pass Gates 1, 2, and 3 they forfeit their opportunity to  \nearn the flat fee bonu s.  Forfeiting t he flat fee bonus for not successively passing Gates 1, 2, and 3  does \nnot impact the contractor\u2019s ability to earn fee at the Final Gate.   \n\nIn alignment with the Statement of Objectives, paragraph, 6.15, the contractor is to deliver engineer  \nreleases starti ng 120 calendar days after contract award and every 60 days thereafter.  It is anticipated  \nthere will be a total of 10 engineering releases and 1 final release throughout the PoP of CLIN 0001.  \n Therefore, the defined Gates for this incentive will focus on a subset of those engineering releases and are \nas stated below:   \nGate 1  - Engineering Release 3   \nGate 2  - Engineering Release 6   \nGate 3  - Engineering Release 9   \nFinal Gate  - AFATDS 7.0 Baseline Release  \n\n Gate 1 (Engineering Release 3), Gate 2 (Engineering Release 6), and Gate 3 (Engineering  \nRelease 9)   \nThe contractor is eligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool for engineering releases 3, 6, and 9  \n(for a total of 30% of the available 5% fee pool i f each gate is achieved successfully).  The contractor is \neligible to earn 10% of the available 5% fee pool at each Gate if the engineering release is delivered to the \nGovernment with n o Priority 1 or 2 errors; no exceptions.  Priority levels are as define d in the AFATDS  \nSRS.  There is no limit on Priority 3 or 4 error rates.  The data used to substantiate this performance  \nassessment will be the contractor\u2019s testing data supplied in the applicable CDRL  A035 \u2013 Software Test  \nDescription.   \n\n Gates 1, 2, and 3 Successively Superior Flat Fee  \nThe contractor is eligible to earn 20% of the available 5% fee pool as a flat fee bonus for successively  \nmeeting Gates 1, 2, and 3, as defined above.  Therefore, if the contractor delivers  all thre e engineering  \nreleases (engineering releases 3, 6, and 9) with  no Priority 1 or 2 errors, they are eligible for the flat fee  \nbonus; no exceptions.  \n\nAs stated under Gates 1, 2, and 3, the priority levels are as defined in the AFATDS SRS.  There is no \nlimit on priority 3 or 4 error rates.  The data used to substantiate this performance assessment will be the \ncontractor\u2019s testing data supplied in the applicable CDRL  A035 \u2013 Software Test Description.   HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  88 of 217 \n\n  \n Final Gat e \nThe contractor is also eligible for 50% of th e available 5% fee pool if the final gate  - AFATDS Baseline  \nRelease meets the baseline requirements outlined in AFATDS SRS.  Contractor compliance with baseline \nrequirements will be monitored by the Government via the documented verification and validation \nmethod for each requirement as outlined in the AFATDS SRS.  The contractor is eligible to earn this fee  \npool whether or not they\u2019ve earned fee at the previous gateway evaluation s.  \n\nBelow is the formula to be utilized:   \n\nAgreed Upon Target Cost  100.00 $                      a\nAvailable Fee  5.00 $                           b\nGate 1 - Engineering Release 3 0.50 $                            b * .1 = c\nGate 2 - Engineering Release 6 0.50 $                            b * .1 = d\nGate 3 - Engineering Release 9 0.50 $                            b * .1 = e\nGate 1-3 Successive Gate Flat Fee Bonu s 1.00 $                           b * .2 = f\nFee Subtotal  2.50 $                           c+d+e+f = g\nFinal Gate - 7.0 Baseline Release  2.50 $                           b * .5 = h\nTotal Fee Earned  5.00 $                           g + h = jPerformance Incentive Calculatio n\n\n*The above table is an example to show calculation/formula, amounts are subject to the agreed upon \ntarget cost.  \n\nNote:  If throughout the course of the contract, the Government approves a request for waiver or request  \nfor deviation on a baseline requirement, the contractor will not be subject to assessment on that  \nrequirement and full fee can continue to be earned v ia this incentive.    \n\n7.3 Incentive #3:  Performance & Schedule (2% Flat Fee Bonus/Disincentive)   \nThis incentive is a Gateway Fee incentive that builds off of Incentive #2, Final Gate.   \n\nThe contractor is  only eligible for this 2% Flat Fee Bonus  if the co ntractor achieves the Final Gate \nunder Incentive # 2, as it is not the Government intention to provide a bonus for providing a software  \nbaseline on time that does not meet baseline requirements.   \n\n Incentive   \nTherefore, if the contractor successfully clear s the Final Gate under Incentive #2 no later than 26 months  \nafter award, the contractor is eligible for a flat fee of 2% of the target cost.  The 2% fee allocated to this  \nincentive is based upon the agreed upon target cost and  does no t increase/decrease if  the contractor  \nrealizes a Target Cost Underrun/Overrun.  The fee available for this incentive will be set at time of awar d \nbased upon the agreed upon target cost and available target fee.   \n  \nDisincentive  \nConversely, if the contractor fails the final gate under Incentive #2  AND does no t deliver the AFATDS  \n7.0 baseline within 26 months of award, the contractor will pay the Government liquidated damages of  \n2% of the target cost.   \n\nIn a situation where the contractor fails the final gate of Incentive #2, but the Government decides to take \nacceptance of the AFATDS 7.0 baseline with known deficiencies  within 26 months of award in order to HC1028 -16-R-0005  \n0004  \nPage  89 of 217 "
