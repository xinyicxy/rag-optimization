To date, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making process. As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new economy and co mmunity that works well for all. Page 2 To that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local economy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational rentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the functional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow human talent simultaneous to the local economy. The Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the value and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment that fosters and accepts failure; creativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship. 1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT In 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of Consolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more than a century. At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce.

To date, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making process. As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new economy and co mmunity that works well for all. Page 2 To that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local economy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational rentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the functional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow human talent simultaneous to the local economy. The Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the value and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment that fosters and accepts failure; creativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship. 1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT In 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of Consolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more than a century. At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce. The dramatic economic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency would not serve their changed circumstances. The Tribune Building Project"

        "is \u201c Construction Manager at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133 based contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase. 1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND The Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the historic Tribune Building along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To date, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making process. As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new economy and co mmunity that works well for all. Page 2 To that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local economy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational rentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the functional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow human talent simultaneous to the local economy. The Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the value and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment that fosters and accepts failure; creativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship. 1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT In 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of Consolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more than a century. At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce. The dramatic economic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency would not serve their changed circumstances. The Tribune Building Project",
        "seeks to support residents in determining their own identity. By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the com munity\u2019s future. 1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE The Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets. Both the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are already meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area. The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local newspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design. The building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant. The revitalization will undoubtedly alter the deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper industry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an accessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers. The Tribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown and riverfront renaissance. The Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids. \uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A. \uf0b7 An Estimate of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \uf0b7 A Project Timeline is provided in Exhi bit C.

        "is \u201c Construction Manager at Risk\u201d ( CMAR), which consists of a n AIA A133 based contract covering the pre -construction and construction phase. 1.3 PROJECT BACKGROUND The Project (tribunebuilding.org) began when Incourage Community Foundati on (incouragecf.org) purchased the historic Tribune Building along the Wisconsin River with the intent that residen ts would decide its future use. To date, over 750 community members have invested more than 4,400 hours in this resident -led decision making process. As determined through this process, the Tribune Bu ilding is a social enterprise helping to shape a new economy and co mmunity that works well for all. Page 2 To that end, the space will include a number of local entrepreneurial operations with benefit to the local economy, including a culinary kitchen, microbrewe ry, cafe/brewpub, creative workshop, and re creational rentals . Further, as Incourage is committed to investing in the people who will inhabit the space as much as the functional space needed for production of their goods and services, the Tribune Building will effectively grow human talent simultaneous to the local economy. The Tribune Building\u2019s operational model is currently being developed to fully realize a space that advances the value and importance of relationships and human potential; an environment that fosters and accepts failure; creativity and innovation; and entrepreneurship. 1.4 COMMUNITY CONTEXT In 2000, the south Wood County area was devastated by economic hardships brought about by the sale of Consolidated Papers Inc. \u2013 a Fortune 500 paper company that had been headquartered in Wood County for more than a century. At its operating peak, the mill employed almost half of the region\u2019s workforce. The dramatic economic shift compelled a shift in community thinking and, in response , residents realized that complacency would not serve their changed circumstances. The Tribune Building Project",
        "seeks to support residents in determining their own identity. By reimagining the building\u2019s future, residents are collectively shaping the com munity\u2019s future. 1.5 PROPERTY SIGNIFICANCE The Tribune Building is centrally located downtown, beside the Wisconsin River and other community assets. Both the site and the 20,000 square foot building leverage historic, local significance and distincti veness that are already meaningful and iconic for th e south Wood County area. The Tribune B uilding is former home to the local newspaper and radio station offices and embodies a unique mid -century modern \u2013 \u201cround \u201d structure design. The building\u2019s close p roximity to the Wisconsin River is also significant. The revitalization will undoubtedly alter the deeply rooted historical perspective of the river as a working asset \u2013 positioned to serve the local paper industry. Once complete, the re -envisioned site w ill serve as a gateway for residents to experience the river as an accessible and cherished natural resource, public recreation place, and destination location for travelers. The Tribune Building\u2019s transformation is paramount to Wisconsin Rapids\u2019 downtown and riverfront renaissance. The Project site address is 220 First Avenue South, Wisconsin Rapids. \uf0b7 The Project Design Documents are provided in Exhibit A. \uf0b7 An Estimate of Probable Costs is provided in Exhibit B . \uf0b7 A Project Timeline is provided in Exhi bit C. All Exhibits are attached to and made part of this RFP. 1.6 CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT RISK PROJECT DELIVERY BACKGROUND INFORMATION (Source: The American Institute of Architects) Construction Management at -risk is a process that allows the Owner of a Project to choose the Construction Manager before the design stage is complete.

The contractor is only eligible for this 2% Flat Fee Bonus if the co ntractor achieves the Final Gate under Incentive # 2, as it is not the Government intention to provide a bonus for providing a software baseline on time that does not meet baseline requirements. Incentive Therefore, if the contractor successfully clear s the Final Gate under Incentive #2 no later than 26 months after award, the contractor is eligible for a flat fee of 2% of the target cost. The 2% fee allocated to this incentive is based upon the agreed upon target cost and does no t increase/decrease if the contractor realizes a Target Cost Underrun/Overrun. The fee available for this incentive will be set at time of awar d based upon the agreed upon target cost and available target fee. Disincentive Conversely, if the contractor fails the final gate under Incentive #2 AND does no t deliver the AFATDS 7.0 baseline within 26 months of award, the contractor will pay the Government liquidated damages of 2% of the target cost. In a situation where the contractor fails the final gate of Incentive #2, but the Government decides to take acceptance of the AFATDS 7.0 baseline with known deficiencies within 26 months of award in order to HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 89 of 217 ensure the delivery of some capability to the Army Force, the contractor w ill not be assesse d for liquidated damages.

This includes both limiting the number of software languages used for implementing new portions o f the software that will be constructed under HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 25 of 217 AFATDS 7.0 as well as looking for opportunities to r e-write existing portions of the system with a common language. It is not the Government\u2019s intent to implement AFATDS 7.0 in its entirety with a single lang uage, but to reduce the variety of software languages used wherever practical to minimize the skillsets required to develop and maintain AFATDS 7.0 and future iterations . 6.2.16 Subtask 16 Mission Command and Computing Environment Standards AFATDS 7.0 is heavi ly interdependent on foundation products and services provided by COE.

Additionally, unbalanced costs pose an unacceptable risk to the Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror\u2019s proposal. Cost submissions should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness and be adequate enough to support and sustain a DCAA audit. 6.1.2 Cost/Price Information Information beyond that required by this instruction shall not be submitted, unless you consider it essential to document or support your cost/price position. All information relating to the proposed price, including all required supporting documentation must be included in the section of the proposal designated as the Cost/Price Volume.

Normally, price reasonableness is established through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. The Government will determine completeness of the offeror's proposal by verifying that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs are presented in a clear and useful format. The Government will evaluate offerors' proposed costs for reasonableness, completeness, affordability and realism. 6.1 General Instructions 6.1.1 Cost Reasonableness, Realism, and Completeness This section is to assist you in submitting cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the reasonableness, completeness, realism, balance, and/or affordability of your proposed cost.

As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this procurement. To f acilitate this relevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a \"roadmap\" describing all such changes in the organization of your company. A pamphlet or other commercial document describing such reorganizations may suffice. As part of this expl anation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/confidence assessment. Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provide d by the offerors, your \"roadmap\" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources . 5.4 Questionnaire s The offeror shall provide the Sample Questionnaire Cover Letter",

HC1028 -16-R-0005 0004 Page 69 of 217 e. The offeror or contractor, by submitting an offer and/or signing the contract, warrants that it is not now aware of any actual or potential OCI relating to this contract . f. After contract award, the contractor shall have an ongoing obligation to make \u201ca prompt and full disclosure\u201d to the Contracting Officer of any OCI that arises during the performance of the contract, as well as newly discovered conflicts that existed before contract award . g.

Organizational COI is a situation where because of other relationships or activities a person (company) is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government or cannot objectively perform contract work or has an unfair competitive advantage. FAR 9.502 states that \u201can organization COI may result when factors create an ac tual or potential conflict of interest on an instant contract, or when the nature of the work to be performed on the instant contract creates an actual or potential COI on a future acquisition.\u201d An organizational COI exists when the nature of the work to b e performed may, without some restriction on future activities, (1) result in an unfair competitive advantage to the contractor on other contracts or (2) impair the contractor\u2019s objectivity in performing the contract work. The primary burden is on the con tractor to identify any organizational COI, however, the Government has the responsibility to identify and evaluate such conflicts. c. Identification of No n-Disclosure Requirements .

The contractor is only eligible for this 2% Flat Fee Bonus if the co ntractor achieves the Final Gate under Incentive # 2, as it is not the Government intention to provide a bonus for providing a software baseline on time that does not meet baseline requirements. Incentive Therefore, if the contractor successfully clear s the Final Gate under Incentive #2 no later than 26 months after award, the contractor is eligible for a flat fee of 2% of the target cost.
